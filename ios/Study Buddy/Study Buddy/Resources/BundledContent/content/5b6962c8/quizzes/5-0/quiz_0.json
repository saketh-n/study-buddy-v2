    {
      "question": "During which phase of incident response should an organization focus on analyzing logs, collecting digital evidence, and determining the scope of a security breach?",
      "options": [
        "Preparation",
        "Detection and Analysis",
        "Containment, Eradication, and Recovery",
        "Post-Incident Activity"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Detection and Analysis is the phase where teams investigate the incident, analyze evidence, and determine the full scope and impact of the security breach before moving to containment."

    {
      "question": "A company discovers that an employee's laptop was infected with ransomware, but the infection hasn't spread to other systems yet. What should be the immediate priority in the incident response process?",
      "options": [
        "Document lessons learned for future prevention",
        "Perform forensic analysis to understand the attack vector",
        "Isolate the infected laptop to prevent lateral movement",
        "Notify law enforcement and regulatory bodies"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Immediate containment is critical to prevent the ransomware from spreading to other systems. While forensic analysis and notifications are important, they should occur after the threat is contained."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it essential to establish clear escalation procedures and communication protocols during the preparation phase of incident response planning?",
      "options": [
        "To ensure compliance with regulatory reporting requirements",
        "To minimize confusion and delays when making critical decisions under pressure",
        "To document evidence for potential legal proceedings",
        "To maintain business operations during an incident"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Clear escalation procedures and communication protocols prevent confusion during high-stress incidents, ensuring quick decision-making and coordinated response when time is critical."
    },
    {
      "question": "An organization's incident response team has successfully contained and eradicated a data breach. Before returning to normal operations, what critical step must be completed to ensure the incident won't immediately reoccur?",
      "options": [
        "Update all employee security awareness training materials",
        "Conduct penetration testing on the entire network infrastructure",
        "Verify that all vulnerabilities exploited in the incident have been patched",
        "Replace all potentially compromised user credentials"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Before restoring systems and returning to normal operations, the organization must ensure that the vulnerabilities that allowed the initial breach have been properly addressed and patched."
    },
    {
      "question": "During post-incident analysis, a security team discovers that the incident could have been detected 3 days earlier if certain log monitoring rules had been in place. This finding should primarily influence which aspect of the incident response program?",
      "options": [
        "Containment procedures for similar future incidents",
        "Employee training on social engineering awareness",
        "Detection capabilities and monitoring strategies",
        "Legal notification requirements and timelines"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "This finding indicates a gap in detection capabilities. The lessons learned should be used to improve monitoring strategies and detection rules to identify similar incidents more quickly in the future."
