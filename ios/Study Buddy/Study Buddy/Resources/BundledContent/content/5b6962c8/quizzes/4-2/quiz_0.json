    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of conducting a vulnerability assessment in an organization's cybersecurity program?",
      "options": [
        "To identify and prioritize security weaknesses before attackers can exploit them",
        "To demonstrate compliance with industry regulations",
        "To test the organization's incident response capabilities",
        "To monitor real-time network traffic for malicious activity"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "While compliance and other activities are important, the primary purpose of vulnerability assessment is proactive identification and prioritization of security weaknesses to prevent exploitation by threat actors."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company discovers a critical vulnerability in their web application during a scheduled assessment. However, patching would require taking the system offline for 6 hours during peak business operations. What should be the immediate next step?",
      "options": [
        "Immediately patch the vulnerability regardless of business impact",
        "Ignore the vulnerability since it was found internally",
        "Implement temporary compensating controls while planning the patch deployment",
        "Wait until the next maintenance window in 3 months to address it"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Critical vulnerabilities require immediate attention, but business continuity must be considered. Compensating controls provide temporary protection while proper patching is planned and scheduled."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which scenario would most likely require a different vulnerability assessment approach compared to a standard network infrastructure assessment?",
      "options": [
        "Assessing a cloud-based environment with auto-scaling capabilities",
        "Evaluating a network with multiple VLANs",
        "Testing systems with different operating systems",
        "Scanning during off-peak hours versus peak hours"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Cloud environments with auto-scaling present unique challenges as infrastructure changes dynamically, requiring specialized assessment techniques and tools compared to static traditional networks."
    },
    {
      "question": "An organization's vulnerability assessment reveals that 40% of identified vulnerabilities are classified as 'Low' severity. How should the security team prioritize addressing these findings?",
      "options": [
        "Address them immediately after critical and high severity issues",
        "Ignore them completely as they pose minimal risk",
        "Focus only on those in internet-facing systems and deprioritize internal ones",
        "Consider them alongside business context, asset criticality, and available resources"
      ],
      "correct_index": 3,
      "explanation": "Even low-severity vulnerabilities should be evaluated in context. Asset criticality, potential attack chains, and resource availability should inform prioritization rather than severity scores alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would an organization choose to perform authenticated vulnerability scans instead of unauthenticated scans?",
      "options": [
        "Authenticated scans are faster and require less network bandwidth",
        "Authenticated scans can identify vulnerabilities that are only visible from an insider's perspective",
        "Authenticated scans are less likely to disrupt system operations",
        "Authenticated scans provide better compliance reporting metrics"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Authenticated scans provide deeper visibility into systems by accessing them with valid credentials, revealing vulnerabilities in configurations, installed software, and missing patches that external scans cannot detect."
