    {
      "question": "A company's security policy states that all employees must use multi-factor authentication, but implementation is inconsistent across departments. What governance structure element is most likely missing?",
      "options": [
        "Policy documentation",
        "Executive sponsorship",
        "Enforcement mechanisms and accountability",
        "Technical standards"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "While the policy exists (documentation), the lack of consistent implementation indicates missing enforcement mechanisms, accountability measures, and oversight to ensure compliance across the organization."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should an organization prioritize updating their incident response policy over other security policies?",
      "options": [
        "When new software is deployed",
        "After a security breach reveals gaps in current procedures",
        "During annual policy reviews only",
        "When compliance auditors request it"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Security breaches that expose procedural gaps create an immediate need to update incident response policies to prevent similar issues. This is more urgent than routine updates or software deployments."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of establishing a security governance committee with representatives from multiple business units?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce IT department workload",
        "To ensure security decisions align with business objectives and gain organizational buy-in",
        "To meet compliance requirements",
        "To centralize all security decision-making"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Cross-functional governance committees ensure security policies support business goals while securing organizational commitment and resources from different departments, making implementation more effective."

    {
      "question": "A financial services company must comply with multiple regulations (SOX, PCI-DSS, GLBA). How should they structure their policy framework to manage this complexity?",
      "options": [
        "Create separate, independent policies for each regulation",
        "Develop a layered framework with overarching policies and specific compliance procedures",
        "Focus only on the most restrictive regulation",
        "Delegate compliance to individual departments"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "A layered approach with high-level policies supported by specific compliance procedures prevents conflicts, reduces redundancy, and ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining consistency across regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "An organization's data classification policy is rarely followed because employees find it too complex. What governance principle should guide the policy revision?",
      "options": [
        "Make policies more detailed to cover all scenarios",
        "Balance security requirements with usability and business needs",
        "Increase penalties for non-compliance",
        "Reduce security requirements to improve adoption"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Effective security governance requires balancing security needs with practical usability. Overly complex policies fail because they hinder productivity, while oversimplified policies may not provide adequate protection."
