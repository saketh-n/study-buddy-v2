      "question": "A company discovers that several employee passwords were compromised in a data breach, but no unauthorized access occurred to their systems. What security measure most likely prevented the attackers from gaining access?",
      "options": [
        "Complex password requirements",
        "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)",
        "Password expiration policies",
        "Account lockout after failed attempts"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Multi-factor authentication would prevent access even with compromised passwords, as attackers would still need the second authentication factor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is biometric authentication generally considered more secure than traditional passwords for user verification?",
      "options": [
        "Biometric data can never be stolen or copied",
        "Biometric traits are unique and difficult to replicate",
        "Biometric systems are cheaper to implement",
        "Biometric authentication is faster than typing passwords"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Biometric traits are unique to individuals and much harder to replicate than passwords, though they can still be compromised and should be used as part of a multi-layered security approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "An organization wants to implement MFA for remote workers accessing sensitive financial data. Which combination would provide the strongest security while remaining practical for daily use?",
      "options": [
        "Password + SMS text code",
        "Password + authenticator app + biometric",
        "Password + security question + email code",
        "Biometric + hardware token"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "This three-factor approach combines something you know (password), something you have (authenticator app), and something you are (biometric), providing the strongest security across all authentication factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "A user creates the password 'MyDog2023!' believing it's secure because it meets complexity requirements. What is the primary weakness of this approach to password security?",
      "options": [
        "The password is too short for modern standards",
        "It contains predictable personal information and common patterns",
        "The exclamation mark makes it vulnerable to dictionary attacks",
        "It should include more special characters"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Despite meeting complexity requirements, passwords based on personal information with predictable patterns (pet name + year + common symbol) are vulnerable to targeted attacks and social engineering."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would an organization choose to implement risk-based authentication rather than requiring MFA for every login attempt?",
      "options": [
        "When biometric systems are too expensive to deploy",
        "When users frequently forget their passwords",
        "When balancing security needs with user experience and operational efficiency",
        "When the organization has a small number of users"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Risk-based authentication evaluates login context (location, device, behavior) to determine when additional authentication is needed, providing strong security while minimizing user friction for routine, low-risk access."
