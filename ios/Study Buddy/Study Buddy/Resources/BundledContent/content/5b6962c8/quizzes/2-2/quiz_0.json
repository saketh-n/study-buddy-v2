    {
      "question": "A company wants to ensure that employees can securely exchange encrypted emails with external partners without having to pre-share secret keys. Which PKI component is most critical for solving this problem?",
      "options": [
        "Private key storage systems",
        "Certificate Authorities (CAs)",
        "Symmetric encryption algorithms",
        "Firewall configurations"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Certificate Authorities are essential because they provide trusted verification of public keys, allowing parties who have never met to establish secure communication without pre-sharing keys. The CA's digital signature on certificates creates the trust foundation needed for secure key exchange."
    },
    {
      "question": "An employee receives a digital certificate error when trying to access a company website, stating 'Certificate has expired.' What is the primary security risk if they choose to proceed anyway?",
      "options": [
        "The website will load slower than normal",
        "An attacker could be impersonating the legitimate website",
        "The employee's password will be stored in plain text",
        "The company's firewall will block future access attempts"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "An expired certificate means the cryptographic binding between the website's identity and its public key is no longer trustworthy. This creates an opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could present their own certificate and intercept communications intended for the legitimate site."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does PKI use asymmetric (public-private key) cryptography instead of only symmetric encryption for secure communications?",
      "options": [
        "Asymmetric encryption is faster than symmetric encryption",
        "Symmetric encryption cannot provide data confidentiality",
        "Asymmetric cryptography solves the key distribution problem",
        "Public keys are more secure than private keys"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "The key distribution problem - how to securely share secret keys between parties who haven't communicated before - is solved by asymmetric cryptography. Public keys can be shared openly, while private keys remain secret, eliminating the need to securely pre-distribute shared secrets."
    },
    {
      "question": "A Certificate Authority's private key has been compromised. What is the most appropriate immediate response to maintain the security of the PKI system?",
      "options": [
        "Generate new public-private key pairs for all end users",
        "Issue a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and establish a new CA",
        "Increase the key length of all existing certificates",
        "Switch to symmetric encryption temporarily"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "When a CA's private key is compromised, all certificates signed by that CA become untrustworthy since an attacker could forge new certificates. The CA must be revoked (via CRL or OCSP), and a new trusted CA must be established to restore the chain of trust."
    },
    {
      "question": "An organization is implementing PKI for 10,000 employees across multiple departments. Which approach would best balance security and manageability?",
      "options": [
        "Each employee generates and manages their own root certificate",
        "Create a single certificate shared by all employees in each department",
        "Establish a hierarchical CA structure with department-level intermediate CAs",
        "Use only self-signed certificates to avoid external dependencies"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "A hierarchical CA structure with intermediate CAs provides the best balance by distributing certificate management responsibilities, enabling department-specific policies, containing security breaches, and maintaining a clear chain of trust back to a root CA while remaining scalable and manageable."
