      "question": "A multinational corporation with employees using various cloud applications wants to reduce password fatigue and improve security. Which approach would be most appropriate and why?",
      "options": [
        "Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) because it centralizes authentication and reduces the attack surface by eliminating multiple passwords",
        "Deploy multi-factor authentication on each application separately to ensure maximum security isolation",
        "Create shared service accounts for teams to use across all applications to simplify access management",
        "Require users to change passwords monthly on all systems to maintain security through frequent rotation"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "SSO centralizes authentication, reduces password fatigue, and actually improves security by eliminating weak or reused passwords across multiple systems while providing centralized access control and audit capabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "In OAuth 2.0, what is the primary role of the authorization server, and why is this separation important?",
      "options": [
        "It stores user passwords and validates them directly for each application request",
        "It issues access tokens after verifying the client's credentials and user consent, separating authorization logic from resource access",
        "It acts as a proxy server that forwards all application requests to the appropriate backend services",
        "It maintains session cookies for all connected applications to enable seamless user experience"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The authorization server's primary role is to issue access tokens after proper authentication and authorization, which separates the concerns of identity verification from resource access, improving security and scalability."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would SAML be preferred over OAuth for an enterprise identity solution?",
      "options": [
        "When building mobile applications that need to access social media APIs",
        "When integrating with legacy enterprise applications that require XML-based assertions and detailed attribute sharing",
        "When creating a simple web application that only needs basic user identification",
        "When implementing machine-to-machine communication between microservices"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "SAML is preferred for enterprise scenarios requiring rich attribute exchange, XML-based assertions, and integration with legacy systems that support SAML's comprehensive identity federation capabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "A security architect is designing an identity federation system for a company that frequently acquires other businesses. What would be the most critical design consideration?",
      "options": [
        "Ensuring all acquired companies immediately adopt the same identity provider technology",
        "Designing the federation to support multiple identity providers with standardized claim mapping and trust relationships",
        "Requiring all users to create new accounts in the parent company's directory service",
        "Implementing separate SSO solutions for each acquired company to maintain independence"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Supporting multiple identity providers with standardized claim mapping allows for flexible integration of acquired companies while maintaining centralized access control and user experience, without forcing immediate technology migrations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key security risk that SSO introduces, and how should organizations mitigate it?",
      "options": [
        "SSO increases network latency, which should be mitigated by using faster servers",
        "SSO creates a single point of failure where compromising one account grants access to all connected systems; this should be mitigated with strong MFA and continuous monitoring",
        "SSO prevents users from having unique passwords for each system, which should be mitigated by requiring longer passwords",
        "SSO reduces encryption strength across all applications, which should be mitigated by using stronger cipher suites"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "SSO's main security risk is that a single compromised account can access all federated systems. This requires robust authentication (like MFA), continuous monitoring, and strong access governance to mitigate the expanded blast radius."
