      "question": "A company discovers that employees are accidentally sending confidential customer data to personal email accounts. Which DLP strategy would be most effective as a primary solution?",
      "options": [
        "Implementing endpoint encryption on all devices",
        "Deploying network-based DLP with email content inspection",
        "Training employees on data classification policies",
        "Installing firewall rules to block external email domains"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Network-based DLP with email content inspection can automatically detect and block sensitive data in real-time before it leaves the organization, directly addressing the transmission issue. While training is important, it doesn't provide technical controls for accidental breaches."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would endpoint-based DLP be preferred over network-based DLP for protecting intellectual property?",
      "options": [
        "When most data breaches occur through email transmission",
        "When employees frequently work remotely and access data offline",
        "When the organization has a simple network topology",
        "When regulatory compliance requires network traffic monitoring"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Endpoint-based DLP is essential when employees work remotely or offline because it monitors and controls data directly on devices, regardless of network connectivity. Network-based DLP only works when data passes through monitored network points."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which scenario represents the most significant limitation of traditional DLP technologies?",
      "options": [
        "An employee printing sensitive documents at home",
        "Detecting credit card numbers in email attachments",
        "A contractor accessing unauthorized database records",
        "An employee uploading encrypted files containing trade secrets to cloud storage"
      ],
      "correct_index": 3,
      "explanation": "Traditional DLP systems struggle with encrypted content because they cannot inspect the actual data within encrypted files. This creates a blind spot where sensitive information can be exfiltrated while appearing as innocuous encrypted data to DLP sensors."
    },
    {
      "question": "A financial services company needs to prevent customer social security numbers from being stored on unauthorized cloud services. Which DLP deployment approach would provide the most comprehensive protection?",
      "options": [
        "Cloud-based DLP only, since the threat involves cloud services",
        "Network-based DLP only, to monitor all outbound traffic",
        "Endpoint-based DLP only, to control user actions directly",
        "A hybrid approach combining network, endpoint, and cloud-based DLP"
      ],
      "correct_index": 3,
      "explanation": "A hybrid approach is most effective because it covers all potential data paths: endpoint DLP prevents local storage violations, network DLP catches transmission attempts, and cloud-based DLP monitors sanctioned cloud applications. Single-point solutions leave coverage gaps."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would an organization implement data classification as a foundational step before deploying DLP technologies?",
      "options": [
        "Data classification automatically prevents data breaches without additional tools",
        "DLP systems can only protect data that has been properly tagged and categorized",
        "Classification reduces the need for employee training on security policies",
        "It eliminates the need for encryption and access controls"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "DLP systems rely on data classification to identify what data needs protection and apply appropriate policies. Without proper classification and tagging, DLP tools cannot distinguish between sensitive and non-sensitive information, making protection policies ineffective."
