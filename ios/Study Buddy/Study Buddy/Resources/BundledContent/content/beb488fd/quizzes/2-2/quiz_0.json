    {
      "question": "Which scenario would be MOST appropriate for implementing a stream processing solution over traditional batch processing?",
      "options": [
        "Processing daily sales reports that need to be generated every morning",
        "Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions within milliseconds of occurrence",
        "Running monthly analytics on customer demographics for marketing campaigns",
        "Backing up database records to a data warehouse once per week"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Stream processing excels at real-time scenarios where immediate response is critical. Fraud detection requires instant analysis to prevent unauthorized transactions, while the other options involve periodic processing that batch systems handle efficiently."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Apache Kafka's architecture, what is the primary purpose of partitioning topics?",
      "options": [
        "To encrypt data for security purposes",
        "To enable parallel processing and horizontal scalability",
        "To compress messages to save storage space",
        "To automatically backup data to multiple data centers"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Partitioning allows Kafka to distribute messages across multiple brokers and enables consumers to process data in parallel, which is essential for achieving high throughput and scalability in distributed systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "A data engineer notices that their Apache Storm topology is experiencing high latency during peak traffic. Which approach would BEST address this issue?",
      "options": [
        "Increase the number of worker processes and redistribute bolts across more executors",
        "Reduce the frequency of data ingestion to lighten the processing load",
        "Switch all processing to synchronous operations to ensure data consistency",
        "Implement a single-threaded processing model to avoid race conditions"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Adding more worker processes and redistributing bolts increases parallelism, allowing Storm to handle higher throughput. The other options would actually decrease performance or contradict stream processing principles."
    },
    {
      "question": "When designing a stream processing pipeline for financial data, why would you implement exactly-once semantic guarantees rather than at-least-once delivery?",
      "options": [
        "Exactly-once processing is always faster than at-least-once delivery",
        "Financial calculations must be precise, and duplicate processing could lead to incorrect account balances",
        "Exactly-once semantics require less memory and computational resources",
        "At-least-once delivery cannot handle high-volume transaction streams"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "In financial systems, duplicate processing of transactions could result in incorrect account balances or double-charging customers. Exactly-once semantics prevent these critical errors, though they typically require more overhead than at-least-once delivery."
    },
    {
      "question": "A stream processing application needs to join real-time click events with user profile data that updates infrequently. What is the most efficient approach?",
      "options": [
        "Store user profiles in the same Kafka topic as click events to enable stream-stream joins",
        "Use a stream-table join where user profiles are maintained in a local state store",
        "Buffer all click events for 24 hours and then perform batch joins with user data",
        "Query the user database synchronously for each incoming click event"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Stream-table joins are optimal when one dataset (clicks) is high-velocity and the other (user profiles) is relatively static. Local state stores provide fast lookups without external database calls, maintaining low latency while ensuring data freshness."
