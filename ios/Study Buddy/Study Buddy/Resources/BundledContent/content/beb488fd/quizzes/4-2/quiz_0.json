    {
      "question": "A data team is experiencing frequent production issues where pipeline changes that work in development break in production due to different data volumes and schemas. Which CI/CD practice would most effectively address this problem?",
      "options": [
        "Implementing automated unit tests for individual functions",
        "Setting up staging environments that mirror production data characteristics",
        "Using version control for all pipeline code",
        "Automating deployment scripts"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Staging environments that mirror production data characteristics help catch issues related to data volume, schema differences, and real-world data patterns that unit tests alone cannot detect."
    },
    {
      "question": "When implementing CI/CD for a data pipeline that processes sensitive customer data, what is the primary reason for implementing data masking or synthetic data generation in the CI/CD process?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce storage costs in testing environments",
        "To comply with data privacy regulations while enabling thorough testing",
        "To improve pipeline performance during testing",
        "To simplify test case creation"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Data masking and synthetic data generation allow teams to test with realistic data patterns while protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR."
    },
    {
      "question": "A data pipeline processes files that arrive irregularly throughout the day. During CI/CD testing, which approach would best validate the pipeline's ability to handle real-world data arrival patterns?",
      "options": [
        "Run tests only with complete daily datasets",
        "Test with synthetic data that simulates irregular arrival times and varying file sizes",
        "Focus testing on the largest possible dataset",
        "Test only during off-peak hours to avoid interference"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Testing with synthetic data that simulates real-world patterns (irregular timing, varying sizes) helps validate that the pipeline handles edge cases and operational scenarios it will encounter in production."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a data pipeline CI/CD setup, why is it important to include data quality validation tests in addition to traditional code testing?",
      "options": [
        "Data quality tests are easier to implement than unit tests",
        "Data transformations can produce syntactically correct but semantically incorrect results",
        "Data quality tests run faster than functional tests",
        "Database connections are unreliable in testing environments"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Data transformations can execute without errors but still produce incorrect business logic results, corrupted aggregations, or invalid data relationships that only data quality tests can detect."
    },
    {
      "question": "A data engineering team wants to implement blue-green deployments for their ETL pipeline. What is the main challenge they need to address that is unique to data pipelines compared to stateless web applications?",
      "options": [
        "Data pipelines consume more computational resources",
        "Managing data consistency and state during the transition between environments",
        "Data pipelines take longer to start up",
        "Version control is more complex for data pipeline code"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Unlike stateless applications, data pipelines maintain state and data consistency. Blue-green deployments must carefully manage data synchronization, prevent duplicate processing, and ensure no data loss during environment switches."
