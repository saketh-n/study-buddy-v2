      "question": "A 25-year-old male with early-stage male pattern baldness (Norwood II) asks about treatment options. What would be the MOST appropriate first-line approach and realistic expectation?",
      "options": [
        "Hair transplant surgery with expectation of full hair restoration",
        "Finasteride with expectation of slowing progression and possible regrowth",
        "Topical steroids with expectation of reversing genetic baldness",
        "Waiting until more advanced stages for better treatment outcomes"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "For early-stage androgenetic alopecia, finasteride is typically first-line treatment. Realistic expectations include slowing progression and potential modest regrowth, not dramatic restoration. Hair transplants are usually reserved for more advanced cases."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it important to identify the underlying cause of hair loss before selecting treatment?",
      "options": [
        "All hair loss treatments work the same regardless of cause",
        "Different causes require different mechanisms of action for effective treatment",
        "Insurance only covers treatments that match the diagnosed cause",
        "Patients prefer to know the cause even if treatment is the same"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Different types of hair loss have different underlying mechanisms (hormonal, autoimmune, nutritional, etc.) and therefore require targeted treatments. Androgenetic alopecia treatments won't help alopecia areata, for example."
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient has been using minoxidil for 8 months and reports 'no improvement.' What is the most likely explanation and appropriate next step?",
      "options": [
        "The treatment has failed and should be discontinued immediately",
        "The patient needs a higher concentration or different formulation",
        "This timeframe is insufficient to judge efficacy; continue treatment",
        "The patient should switch to oral medications immediately"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Minoxidil typically requires 6-12 months to show visible results, and initial shedding may make hair appear worse initially. Many patients expect faster results and may discontinue effective treatments prematurely."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would combination therapy be most appropriate for treating hair loss?",
      "options": [
        "Only when single treatments have completely failed",
        "When targeting multiple pathways of the same hair loss mechanism",
        "As first-line treatment for all types of hair loss",
        "Only for patients over 40 years old"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Combination therapy (e.g., finasteride + minoxidil) can be more effective because they target different aspects of androgenetic alopecia - hormonal reduction and increased blood flow respectively, providing synergistic effects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the most important factor to consider when setting treatment expectations with a hair loss patient?",
      "options": [
        "Patient's age and gender only",
        "Cost and insurance coverage",
        "Stage of hair loss, treatment mechanism, and individual response variability",
        "Patient's desired timeline for results"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Realistic expectations depend on multiple factors: how advanced the hair loss is, how the treatment works, and individual biological variation in response. Age, gender, cost, and patient desires are relevant but secondary to these biological realities."
