      ],
      "correct_index": 1,

      "question": "Why did French forces initially have tactical advantages over English colonial forces during King William's War?",
      "options": [
        "France had significantly more settlers in North America",
        "French colonists received better military training in Europe",

      "question": "The Treaty of Ryswick (1697) ending King William's War returned most conquered territories to their original owners. What does this outcome reveal about the nature of this conflict?",
      "options": [
        "Neither side had the resources to maintain distant territorial conquests",
        "The war was primarily a European conflict with North American territories used as bargaining chips",
        "Native American resistance made permanent conquest impossible",
        "Both powers realized cooperation was more profitable than conflict"

    {
      "question": "A colonial governor in 1695 needs to decide whether to attack a French settlement or focus on defending existing territory. Which factor from King William's War would be most important for making this strategic decision?",
      "options": [
        "The religious composition of the target settlement",
        "Whether local Native American tribes support the French or remain neutral",
        "The agricultural productivity of the target area",
        "The number of European-trained soldiers available"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Native American alliances were crucial determining factors in colonial warfare success. Attacking settlements with strong Native support would likely fail, while areas with neutral or hostile Native relations with the French offered better prospects."

        "It showed that colonial conflicts would mirror European diplomatic cycles and depend heavily on Native American alliances",
        "It established that religious conversion was the key to territorial control"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "King William's War established the pattern where North American colonial conflicts would follow European political cycles, while success depended critically on securing Native American partnerships rather than purely European military tactics."
