      "student_choice": "OSPF converges faster and supports hierarchical network design through areas",
      "correct_answer": "OSPF converges faster and supports hierarchical network design through areas",
      "analysis": "Great job!",
      "explanation": "OSPF converges faster than RIP due to its link-state algorithm and supports hierarchical design through areas, which improves scalability and reduces routing overhead in large networks."

      "question_num": 2,
      "is_correct": true,
      "student_choice": "To serve as the central transit area that connects all other areas",
      "correct_answer": "To serve as the central transit area that connects all other areas",
      "analysis": "Great job!",
      "explanation": "Area 0 serves as the backbone area that all other areas must connect to, either directly or through virtual links, ensuring proper inter-area routing and maintaining the hierarchical OSPF design."

      "is_correct": true,
      "student_choice": "When it has been configured with the highest router priority, or highest router ID if priorities are equal",
      "correct_answer": "When it has been configured with the highest router priority, or highest router ID if priorities are equal",
      "analysis": "Great job!",
      "explanation": "The DR is elected based on the highest router priority (configurable value), and if priorities are tied, then the highest router ID is used as the tiebreaker."

      "question_num": 4,
      "is_correct": true,
      "student_choice": "OSPF maintains full topology awareness through link-state advertisements, enabling faster recalculation of paths",
      "correct_answer": "OSPF maintains full topology awareness through link-state advertisements, enabling faster recalculation of paths",
      "analysis": "Great job!",
      "explanation": "OSPF's link-state algorithm maintains complete network topology information, allowing routers to immediately recalculate shortest paths when topology changes occur, resulting in faster convergence than distance-vector protocols."

      "student_choice": "Discard the LSA as it contains outdated information",
      "correct_answer": "Discard the LSA as it contains outdated information",
      "analysis": "Great job!",
      "explanation": "OSPF sequence numbers increase with each new LSA version. A lower sequence number indicates older, outdated information that should be discarded to maintain database consistency."
