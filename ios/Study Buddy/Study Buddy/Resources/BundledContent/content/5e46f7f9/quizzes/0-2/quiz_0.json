      "question": "A company has been assigned the network 172.20.0.0/16 and needs to create 30 separate subnets for different departments while maximizing the number of hosts per subnet. What subnet mask should they use?",
      "options": [
        "/21 (255.255.248.0)",
        "/22 (255.255.252.0)",
        "/20 (255.255.240.0)",
        "/19 (255.255.224.0)"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Using /21 provides 32 subnets (2^5 = 32) which meets the requirement of 30 subnets, while leaving 11 host bits for 2046 hosts per subnet. /22 would only give 16 subnets, while /20 and /19 provide fewer hosts per subnet unnecessarily."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would a network administrator choose to use the 10.0.0.0/8 private address range instead of 192.168.0.0/16 for a large enterprise network?",
      "options": [
        "10.x addresses have better routing performance",
        "10.x addresses provide more available IP addresses for hosts",
        "10.x addresses are more secure than 192.168.x addresses",
        "10.x addresses work better with IPv6 dual-stack configurations"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The 10.0.0.0/8 range provides approximately 16.7 million addresses (24 host bits), while 192.168.0.0/16 only provides about 65,000 addresses (16 host bits). For large enterprises with many devices, the 10.x range offers much more addressing space."
    },
    {
      "question": "An organization receives the IPv6 prefix 2001:db8:abcd::/48 from their ISP. They need to create 256 subnets for their campus network. What would be the appropriate subnet prefix length?",
      "options": [
        "/56",
        "/64",
        "/52",
        "/60"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Starting with /48, they need 8 more bits to create 256 subnets (2^8 = 256). Adding 8 bits to the /48 gives /56. This leaves 8 bits for subnetting and maintains the standard /64 for host addressing when further subdivided."
    },
    {
      "question": "A network technician discovers that devices on subnet 192.168.1.0/24 cannot communicate with devices on 192.168.2.0/24, even though both subnets are connected to the same switch. What is the most likely cause of this connectivity issue?",
      "options": [
        "The switch ports are configured for different VLANs",
        "The subnets are using different subnet masks",
        "A router is needed because the devices are on different networks",
        "The 192.168.x addresses are conflicting with public internet addresses"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Devices on different IP networks (192.168.1.0/24 vs 192.168.2.0/24) cannot communicate directly even if physically connected to the same switch. Layer 3 routing is required to forward packets between different IP networks."
    },
    {
      "question": "When designing a network that needs to support both IPv4 and IPv6, why might an administrator avoid using the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet specifically?",
      "options": [
        "It conflicts with common home router default configurations",
        "It cannot be properly mapped to IPv6 address space",
        "It has insufficient addresses for dual-stack requirements",
        "It is not a valid private IP range for enterprise use"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Many consumer routers use 192.168.0.0/24 or 192.168.1.0/24 by default. Using these ranges in enterprise networks can create conflicts when employees connect VPN clients from home networks using the same addressing scheme, causing routing issues."
