    {
      "question": "Why would a network administrator choose OSPF over RIP for routing within a large enterprise network?",
      "options": [
        "OSPF has simpler configuration requirements",
        "OSPF uses hop count as its metric which is more accurate",
        "OSPF converges faster and supports larger networks without routing loops",
        "OSPF automatically balances traffic across all available paths"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "OSPF uses link-state routing with Dijkstra's algorithm, enabling faster convergence and loop-free routing in large networks, unlike RIP's distance-vector approach which has convergence issues and hop count limitations."
    },
    {
      "question": "In an OSPF network, what is the primary purpose of dividing the autonomous system into areas?",
      "options": [
        "To enable different routing protocols in each area",
        "To reduce routing table size and limit LSA flooding scope",
        "To automatically load balance traffic between areas",
        "To prevent any communication between different network segments"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "OSPF areas create hierarchical routing that reduces routing table sizes and limits Link State Advertisement (LSA) flooding to specific areas, improving scalability and reducing processing overhead."
    },
    {
      "question": "A network has multiple equal-cost paths between two destinations. How does OSPF handle this scenario by default?",
      "options": [
        "Uses only the first path discovered",
        "Alternates between paths for each packet",
        "Performs load balancing across all equal-cost paths",
        "Randomly selects one path and uses it exclusively"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "OSPF supports Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing by default, automatically distributing traffic across all paths with the same lowest cost to improve bandwidth utilization and provide redundancy."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would an OSPF Designated Router (DR) election occur on a network segment?",
      "options": [
        "Only when manually configured by an administrator",
        "On point-to-point links to reduce overhead",
        "On multi-access networks like Ethernet to minimize LSA exchanges",
        "When connecting different OSPF areas together"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "DR election happens on multi-access networks (like Ethernet) to reduce the number of adjacencies and LSA exchanges. On a network with n routers, DR/BDR reduces adjacencies from n(n-1)/2 to 2(n-1)."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company's OSPF network is experiencing slow convergence after link failures. What is the most likely cause and solution?",
      "options": [
        "Too many areas configured; consolidate into a single area",
        "Insufficient bandwidth; upgrade all links to higher capacity",
        "Large single area with many routers; implement proper area hierarchy",
        "Incorrect router IDs; manually assign sequential numbers"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "A large flat OSPF area causes slow convergence because every router must recalculate the entire topology. Implementing hierarchical areas (connecting via Area 0) localizes topology changes and speeds convergence."
