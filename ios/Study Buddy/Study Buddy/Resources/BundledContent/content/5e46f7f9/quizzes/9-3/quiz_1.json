    {
      "question": "When would you choose AWS App Mesh over AWS Application Load Balancer for managing traffic between microservices?",
      "options": [
        "When you need advanced service-to-service communication features like retries, circuit breakers, and distributed tracing across multiple services",
        "When you only need to distribute traffic between multiple instances of a single service",
        "When you want to reduce infrastructure costs by eliminating the need for proxies",
        "When you need to handle traffic from external users to your application"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "App Mesh provides advanced service mesh capabilities including retries, circuit breakers, observability, and traffic management between services, while ALB is primarily for load balancing external traffic to services."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary role of Envoy proxy sidecars in AWS App Mesh architecture?",
      "options": [
        "To replace the need for service discovery mechanisms",
        "To intercept and manage all network traffic between services while implementing mesh policies",
        "To store application data and provide caching capabilities",
        "To serve as the primary application runtime environment"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Envoy sidecars act as intelligent proxies that intercept service-to-service communication and enforce mesh policies like routing, retries, circuit breaking, and observability without requiring application code changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which scenario best illustrates when to implement circuit breakers in a service mesh?",
      "options": [
        "When you need to encrypt all traffic between services",
        "When a downstream service is experiencing failures and you want to prevent cascading failures by temporarily stopping requests to it",
        "When you want to distribute traffic evenly across multiple service instances",
        "When you need to authenticate requests between services"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Circuit breakers monitor service health and temporarily block requests to failing services to prevent cascading failures and allow time for recovery, improving overall system resilience."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does AWS Lattice differ from AWS App Mesh in terms of service mesh implementation?",
      "options": [
        "Lattice requires manual installation of sidecar proxies while App Mesh is serverless",
        "Lattice provides application-layer service networking without requiring sidecar proxies, while App Mesh uses Envoy sidecars",
        "Lattice only works with Lambda functions while App Mesh works with containers",
        "Lattice is designed for monolithic applications while App Mesh is for microservices"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "AWS Lattice provides service-to-service connectivity and traffic management without requiring sidecar proxies, operating at the VPC level, while App Mesh uses Envoy sidecars for traffic interception and management."

    {
      "question": "In a microservices architecture experiencing intermittent network issues, what combination of service mesh features would best improve reliability?",
      "options": [
        "Load balancing and SSL termination only",
        "Service discovery and API gateway integration",
        "Automatic retries with exponential backoff and circuit breakers to handle transient failures and service degradation",
        "Container orchestration and auto-scaling policies"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Retries with exponential backoff handle transient network issues by automatically retrying failed requests, while circuit breakers prevent overwhelming degraded services, together providing comprehensive resilience against intermittent failures."
