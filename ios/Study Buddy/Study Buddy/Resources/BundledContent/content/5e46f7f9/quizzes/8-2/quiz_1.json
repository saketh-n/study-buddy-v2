    {
      "question": "What is the fundamental principle that distinguishes ZTNA from traditional network security models?",
      "options": [
        "Network perimeter-based security with firewall protection",
        "Trust verification required for every access request regardless of location",
        "Password-based authentication with network segmentation",
        "VPN tunneling with encrypted connections"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "ZTNA operates on the principle of 'never trust, always verify' - requiring verification for every access request regardless of whether it comes from inside or outside the network perimeter."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company has remote employees accessing sensitive applications through a traditional VPN that grants broad network access. Why would ZTNA be a better solution in this scenario?",
      "options": [
        "ZTNA provides faster connection speeds than VPN",
        "ZTNA grants granular access to specific applications based on user identity and context",
        "ZTNA eliminates the need for user authentication",
        "ZTNA automatically blocks all external threats"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "ZTNA provides application-specific access based on user identity, device posture, and contextual factors, reducing the attack surface compared to VPN's broad network access."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a ZTNA implementation, what happens when a user's device compliance status changes during an active session?",
      "options": [
        "The session continues unchanged until manual logout",
        "Access is immediately revoked or restricted based on the new compliance status",
        "The system sends a warning but maintains full access",
        "Only new connection attempts are affected"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "ZTNA continuously monitors and evaluates access decisions in real-time, dynamically adjusting or revoking access when security posture changes during active sessions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which scenario best demonstrates the application-centric approach of ZTNA compared to traditional network security?",
      "options": [
        "Blocking all traffic from specific IP ranges",
        "Allowing HR employees to access only the HRIS application from managed devices during business hours",
        "Creating VLANs for different departments",
        "Implementing network-wide encryption"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario shows ZTNA's fine-grained, policy-based access control that considers user role, specific application, device trust, and contextual factors like time and location."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would an organization choose ZTNA over simply upgrading their existing VPN infrastructure?",
      "options": [
        "When they need to reduce bandwidth costs",
        "When they require micro-segmentation and least-privilege access to cloud and on-premises applications",
        "When they want to eliminate all user authentication requirements",
        "When they need to support only on-premises applications"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "ZTNA is chosen when organizations need granular, application-level access control and micro-segmentation that traditional VPNs cannot provide, especially in hybrid cloud environments."
