      "question": "A network administrator notices that devices are receiving IP addresses outside the intended range and some devices cannot connect to the internet. What is the most likely cause and solution?",
      "options": [
        "Multiple DHCP servers on the network; implement DHCP snooping or disable unauthorized servers",
        "DNS server failure; restart the DNS service",
        "Network switch malfunction; replace the core switch",
        "Insufficient bandwidth; upgrade internet connection"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Multiple DHCP servers can cause IP conflicts and assignment of incorrect network parameters. DHCP snooping helps prevent rogue DHCP servers from operating on the network."
    },
    {
      "question": "In what scenario would configuring DHCP reservations be the most appropriate solution?",
      "options": [
        "When you want to reduce network traffic",
        "When servers need consistent IP addresses but you want centralized IP management",
        "When you need to increase DHCP lease time",
        "When you want to prevent IP address conflicts"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "DHCP reservations ensure specific devices always receive the same IP address while maintaining the benefits of centralized DHCP management, ideal for servers that need consistent IPs."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company's DHCP server assigns IP addresses with a 24-hour lease time, but mobile devices frequently disconnect and reconnect throughout the day. What problem might this create and how should it be addressed?",
      "options": [
        "No problem; 24 hours is optimal for all devices",
        "IP address pool exhaustion; reduce lease time for mobile devices",
        "Increased security risks; disable DHCP for mobile devices",
        "DNS resolution failures; increase lease time to 72 hours"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Mobile devices that frequently disconnect may not properly release their leases, leading to pool exhaustion. Shorter lease times for mobile devices ensure addresses are returned to the pool more quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "During the DHCP process, why is the DHCPREQUEST message broadcast rather than sent directly to the DHCP server?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce network latency",
        "To inform all DHCP servers which offer was accepted and allow others to reclaim their offered addresses",
        "To encrypt the communication for security",
        "To ensure the message reaches the default gateway"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Broadcasting the DHCPREQUEST allows all DHCP servers that made offers to know which offer was accepted, enabling them to return unused offered addresses to their available pools."
    },
    {
      "question": "An organization wants to automatically assign different network configurations to laptops versus desktop computers. Which DHCP feature would best accomplish this requirement?",
      "options": [
        "DHCP relay agents",
        "DHCP scopes with different subnets",
        "DHCP vendor classes or user classes",
        "DHCP failover configuration"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "DHCP vendor classes or user classes allow the server to identify different device types and assign appropriate configurations (like different DNS servers, gateways, or lease times) based on device characteristics."
