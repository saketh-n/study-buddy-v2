    {
      "question": "What is the primary architectural purpose of using Envoy proxy sidecars in AWS App Mesh?",
      "options": [
        "To intercept and manage all network communication between services without modifying application code",
        "To replace load balancers and eliminate the need for AWS Application Load Balancer",
        "To provide direct database connections and cache frequently accessed data",
        "To serve as a backup service instance in case the primary application fails"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Envoy sidecars act as intermediary proxies that handle service-to-service communication, providing features like traffic routing, observability, and security without requiring changes to the application code itself."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would you choose AWS VPC Lattice over AWS App Mesh for a microservices architecture?",
      "options": [
        "When you need fine-grained traffic policies and advanced observability with custom metrics",
        "When you want to connect services across multiple VPCs and accounts with simplified networking",
        "When you require complex retry logic and sophisticated circuit breaker patterns",
        "When you need to implement mutual TLS authentication between all service endpoints"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "AWS VPC Lattice is designed for multi-VPC and cross-account service connectivity with simplified networking, while App Mesh focuses more on advanced traffic management and observability within a more tightly coupled environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does a circuit breaker pattern in service mesh help prevent cascade failures?",
      "options": [
        "By automatically scaling up healthy service instances when failures are detected",
        "By redirecting all traffic to a backup data center when errors occur",
        "By temporarily blocking requests to a failing service and allowing it time to recover",
        "By implementing authentication checks to prevent malicious requests"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Circuit breakers monitor service health and temporarily stop sending requests to failing services, preventing the failure from cascading to other services and giving the failing service time to recover."
    },
    {
      "question": "In AWS App Mesh, what happens when you configure weighted routing to gradually shift traffic from version A to version B of a service?",
      "options": [
        "The mesh automatically monitors performance metrics and adjusts weights based on error rates",
        "Envoy proxies distribute requests according to the specified percentages while maintaining session affinity",
        "The old version instances are gradually terminated as traffic decreases to them",
        "Users are permanently assigned to either version A or B based on their geographic location"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Weighted routing in App Mesh allows Envoy proxies to distribute traffic based on configured percentages, enabling gradual rollouts and canary deployments while maintaining control over traffic distribution."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would implementing exponential backoff in retry policies within a service mesh be more effective than simple retry attempts?",
      "options": [
        "It ensures that retries happen faster, reducing overall response time for users",
        "It prevents overwhelming a recovering service by increasing delays between successive retry attempts",
        "It guarantees that all retry attempts will eventually succeed within a fixed time window",
        "It automatically routes retries to different service instances in round-robin fashion"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Exponential backoff increases the delay between retry attempts, which helps prevent a recovering service from being immediately overwhelmed again by retry traffic, giving it breathing room to stabilize."
