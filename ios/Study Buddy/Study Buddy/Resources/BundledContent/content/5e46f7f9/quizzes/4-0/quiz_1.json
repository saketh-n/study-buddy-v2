    {
      "question": "Why would a network administrator choose OSPF over RIP for routing within a large autonomous system?",
      "options": [
        "OSPF uses fewer CPU resources and has simpler configuration",
        "OSPF converges faster and supports hierarchical network design through areas",
        "OSPF works better with external routing protocols like BGP",
        "OSPF requires less memory and broadcasts fewer routing updates"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "OSPF converges faster than RIP due to its link-state algorithm and supports hierarchical design through areas, which improves scalability and reduces routing overhead in large networks."
    },
    {
      "question": "In an OSPF network with multiple areas, what is the primary purpose of Area 0 (backbone area)?",
      "options": [
        "To store backup routing tables for all other areas",
        "To provide redundancy in case other areas fail",
        "To serve as the central transit area that connects all other areas",
        "To handle external routing advertisements from other autonomous systems"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Area 0 serves as the backbone area that all other areas must connect to, either directly or through virtual links, ensuring proper inter-area routing and maintaining the hierarchical OSPF design."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would an OSPF router become a Designated Router (DR) in a broadcast network segment?",
      "options": [
        "When it has the highest IP address on the segment",
        "When it has been configured with the highest router priority, or highest router ID if priorities are equal",
        "When it has the most direct connections to other OSPF areas",
        "When it has the fastest processor and most memory"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The DR is elected based on the highest router priority (configurable value), and if priorities are tied, then the highest router ID is used as the tiebreaker."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company's network is experiencing slow convergence after link failures. They currently use distance-vector routing. Which characteristic of OSPF would best address this problem?",
      "options": [
        "OSPF uses hop count as its metric, providing simpler calculations",
        "OSPF maintains full topology awareness through link-state advertisements, enabling faster recalculation of paths",
        "OSPF automatically creates backup routes without administrator configuration",
        "OSPF reduces the number of routing updates by using hierarchical addressing"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "OSPF's link-state algorithm maintains complete network topology information, allowing routers to immediately recalculate shortest paths when topology changes occur, resulting in faster convergence than distance-vector protocols."
    },
    {
      "question": "An OSPF router receives an LSA (Link State Advertisement) with a sequence number lower than what it already has in its database. What should the router do?",
      "options": [
        "Accept the LSA and update its database since newer LSAs always have lower sequence numbers",
        "Discard the LSA as it contains outdated information",
        "Forward the LSA to neighbors but not update its own database",
        "Send a database synchronization request to verify the correct sequence"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "OSPF sequence numbers increase with each new LSA version. A lower sequence number indicates older, outdated information that should be discarded to maintain database consistency."
