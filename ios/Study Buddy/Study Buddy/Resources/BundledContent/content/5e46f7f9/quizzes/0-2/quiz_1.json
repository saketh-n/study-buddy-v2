      "question": "A company with 500 employees needs to set up an internal network that won't conflict with internet routing. Which IP address range would be most appropriate and why?",
      "options": [
        "10.1.0.0/16 because it provides enough addresses and is guaranteed not to be routed on the internet",
        "192.168.1.0/24 because it's the most commonly used private range",
        "172.31.0.0/16 because it's in the middle of the private ranges",
        "8.8.8.0/24 because Google uses it so it must be reliable"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "10.1.0.0/16 from the 10.0.0.0/8 private range provides 65,534 host addresses, which is sufficient for 500+ employees with room for growth. Private IP ranges are non-routable on the internet, preventing conflicts. Option D uses Google's public DNS range, which would cause routing conflicts."
    },
    {
      "question": "You need to subnet a /24 network to create 6 separate departments with at least 25 hosts each. What subnet mask should you use and why?",
      "options": [
        "/27 (255.255.255.224) because it creates 8 subnets with 30 hosts each",
        "/26 (255.255.255.192) because it creates 4 subnets with 62 hosts each",
        "/28 (255.255.255.240) because it creates 16 subnets with 14 hosts each",
        "/25 (255.255.255.128) because it creates 2 subnets with 126 hosts each"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "A /27 subnet mask borrows 3 bits for subnets (2\u00b3 = 8 subnets) and leaves 5 bits for hosts (2\u2075 - 2 = 30 usable hosts per subnet). This meets the requirement of 6 subnets with at least 25 hosts each. /28 provides too few hosts (14), while /26 and /25 don't provide enough subnets."

    {
      "question": "An organization is transitioning to IPv6. What is the primary advantage of IPv6 addressing over IPv4 in terms of network design?",
      "options": [
        "IPv6 is faster because it has shorter headers",
        "IPv6 eliminates the need for NAT in most scenarios due to its vast address space",
        "IPv6 automatically provides better security than IPv4",
        "IPv6 uses simpler routing protocols that require less configuration"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "IPv6's 128-bit address space (compared to IPv4's 32-bit) provides approximately 3.4 \u00d7 10\u00b3\u2078 addresses, eliminating address scarcity. This removes the need for Network Address Translation (NAT) in most cases, simplifying network architecture and enabling end-to-end connectivity. The other options contain misconceptions about IPv6's inherent capabilities."

      "question": "A network administrator discovers that devices on subnet 192.168.1.0/26 cannot communicate with devices on 192.168.1.64/26, even though they're connected to the same physical switch. What is the most likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "The subnets are using different private IP ranges that cannot communicate",
        "The devices are on different logical subnets and need a router to communicate",
        "There's a hardware failure in the switch preventing communication",
        "The subnet masks are incorrectly configured on the devices"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "192.168.1.0/26 covers addresses 192.168.1.1-62, while 192.168.1.64/26 covers 192.168.1.65-126. These are separate logical subnets that require Layer 3 routing to communicate, even on the same physical switch. Devices in different subnets cannot communicate directly at Layer 2."

    {
      "question": "When would you choose to use the 172.16.0.0/12 private range instead of 10.0.0.0/8 or 192.168.0.0/16 for your network design?",
      "options": [
        "When you need exactly 12 bits for host addressing",
        "When you need a medium-sized address space that balances between the very large 10.x.x.x range and the small 192.168.x.x range",
        "When your network equipment only supports Class B addressing",
        "When you want to avoid conflicts with home router default configurations"
      ],
      "correct_index": 3,
      "explanation": "The 172.16.0.0/12 range (172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255) is less commonly used in home/small office environments compared to 192.168.x.x, reducing potential VPN and remote access conflicts. While it does provide a medium address space, the primary practical reason for choosing it is often to avoid the ubiquitous use of 192.168.x.x in consumer devices and 10.x.x.x in many corporate environments."
