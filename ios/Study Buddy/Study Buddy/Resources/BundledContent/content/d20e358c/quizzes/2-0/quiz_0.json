    {
      "question": "A development team needs to ensure that containers running on the same host cannot see each other's processes. Which Linux feature would be most appropriate for this isolation requirement?",
      "options": [
        "cgroups with CPU limits",
        "PID namespaces",
        "overlay2 filesystem",
        "chroot jail"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "PID namespaces provide process isolation by giving each container its own process ID space, preventing containers from seeing processes in other namespaces."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would you choose an overlay filesystem over simply copying files for each container instance?",
      "options": [
        "Overlay filesystems provide better security isolation",
        "Overlay filesystems use less disk space by sharing common layers",
        "Overlay filesystems are faster for CPU-intensive operations",
        "Overlay filesystems automatically compress data"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Overlay filesystems enable efficient storage by allowing multiple containers to share read-only base layers while maintaining separate writable layers for changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "A containerized application is consuming all available CPU resources and affecting other containers on the same host. Which Linux feature should be configured to prevent this issue?",
      "options": [
        "Network namespaces",
        "Mount namespaces",
        "cgroups",
        "User namespaces"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "cgroups (control groups) provide resource management and limits for CPU, memory, I/O, and other system resources to prevent containers from monopolizing host resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary limitation of using chroot alone for container isolation compared to modern container technologies?",
      "options": [
        "chroot cannot change the root directory",
        "chroot only provides filesystem isolation, not process or resource isolation",
        "chroot requires root privileges to execute",
        "chroot is incompatible with overlay filesystems"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "chroot only changes the apparent root directory for a process but doesn't provide process isolation, resource limits, or network isolation that modern containers require."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would you specifically need to configure user namespaces in a container environment?",
      "options": [
        "To limit network bandwidth usage",
        "To run containers as non-root users while maintaining necessary privileges inside the container",
        "To share files between multiple containers",
        "To prevent containers from accessing the internet"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "User namespaces allow mapping of user and group IDs, enabling containers to run with root privileges inside the container while running as unprivileged users on the host system."
