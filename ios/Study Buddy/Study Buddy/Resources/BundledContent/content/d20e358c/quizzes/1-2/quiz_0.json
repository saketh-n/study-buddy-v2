      "question": "What is the primary advantage of Amazon EC2's elasticity feature for a web application experiencing unpredictable traffic patterns?",
      "options": [
        "It automatically backs up your data to prevent loss",
        "It allows you to scale compute resources up or down based on demand without manual intervention",
        "It provides built-in load balancing across multiple regions",
        "It encrypts all data transmission between servers"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "EC2's elasticity allows automatic scaling of compute resources based on demand, which is crucial for handling unpredictable traffic without over-provisioning or under-provisioning resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "A startup needs to run a development environment that will be used inconsistently throughout the month. Which EC2 pricing model would be most cost-effective?",
      "options": [
        "Reserved Instances with 3-year commitment",
        "On-Demand Instances",
        "Spot Instances",
        "Dedicated Hosts"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Spot Instances offer significant cost savings (up to 90%) for workloads that can tolerate interruption, making them ideal for development environments with flexible usage patterns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would you choose EC2 over a traditional containerization solution like Docker running on your own servers for a mission-critical application?",
      "options": [
        "EC2 instances are always faster than containers",
        "EC2 provides managed infrastructure, high availability, and eliminates server maintenance overhead",
        "EC2 instances use less memory than containers",
        "EC2 automatically converts applications to microservices"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "EC2 provides managed infrastructure with built-in high availability, automatic hardware replacement, and eliminates the need to manage physical servers, which is crucial for mission-critical applications."
    },
    {
      "question": "When designing a multi-tier web application on EC2, what is the most important factor to consider regarding instance placement for optimal performance and reliability?",
      "options": [
        "All instances should be placed in the same Availability Zone for lowest latency",
        "Instances should be distributed across multiple Availability Zones for fault tolerance",
        "All instances should use the same instance type for consistency",
        "Instances should be placed in different regions for better performance"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Distributing instances across multiple Availability Zones provides fault tolerance and high availability, as each AZ is a separate failure domain with independent power and networking."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company needs to run batch processing jobs that can take 6-12 hours to complete and can be interrupted and restarted. The jobs run once per week. What EC2 strategy would minimize costs while meeting requirements?",
      "options": [
        "Use Reserved Instances with partial upfront payment",
        "Use On-Demand Instances during off-peak hours",
        "Use Spot Instances with checkpointing to handle interruptions",
        "Use Dedicated Instances for consistent performance"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Spot Instances with checkpointing is ideal for fault-tolerant, time-flexible batch jobs, providing up to 90% cost savings. The ability to restart makes interruptions manageable."
