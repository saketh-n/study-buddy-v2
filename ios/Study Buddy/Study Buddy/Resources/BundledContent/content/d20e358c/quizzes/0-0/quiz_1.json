      "question": "A company needs to run multiple operating systems on a single physical server for production workloads with maximum performance and security isolation. Which VMM architecture would be most appropriate and why?",
      "options": [
        "Type 2 hypervisor because it provides better hardware abstraction",
        "Type 1 hypervisor because it runs directly on hardware with minimal overhead",
        "Type 2 hypervisor because it's easier to manage through the host OS",
        "Type 1 hypervisor because it requires less memory per virtual machine"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Type 1 hypervisors (bare-metal) run directly on hardware without a host OS, providing better performance, security isolation, and lower overhead for production environments compared to Type 2 hypervisors that run on top of an existing OS."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary architectural difference between VMware ESXi and VMware Fusion that determines their use cases?",
      "options": [
        "ESXi supports more virtual machines than Fusion",
        "ESXi is a Type 1 hypervisor while Fusion is a Type 2 hypervisor",
        "ESXi only runs on Intel processors while Fusion supports AMD",
        "ESXi provides better graphics acceleration than Fusion"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The key difference is architectural: ESXi is a bare-metal Type 1 hypervisor that runs directly on server hardware, while Fusion is a hosted Type 2 hypervisor that runs on top of macOS, making them suitable for different environments (datacenter vs. desktop)."

    {
      "question": "A developer wants to test applications on different operating systems on their laptop while continuing to use their primary OS for daily work. Which scenario best describes the trade-offs they should consider?",
      "options": [
        "Use Type 1 hypervisor for better performance but lose access to host OS applications",
        "Use Type 2 hypervisor for convenience but accept higher resource overhead and potential performance impact",
        "Use Type 1 hypervisor for better security isolation of test environments",
        "Use Type 2 hypervisor because it provides direct hardware access to VMs"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "For desktop development scenarios, Type 2 hypervisors offer the convenience of running VMs alongside the host OS but come with resource overhead since both the host OS and hypervisor compete for system resources, unlike Type 1 hypervisors that have direct hardware access."
    },
    {
      "question": "In terms of the privilege ring model, how do Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors differ in their execution context?",
      "options": [
        "Type 1 runs in Ring 0, Type 2 runs in Ring 1",
        "Type 1 runs in Ring -1 or 0, Type 2 runs as an application in Ring 3",
        "Both run in Ring 0 but Type 1 has hardware extensions",
        "Type 1 runs in Ring 3, Type 2 runs in Ring 0"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Type 1 hypervisors run at the highest privilege level (Ring -1 with hardware virtualization extensions or Ring 0), while Type 2 hypervisors run as applications in Ring 3 on top of a host OS, which limits their direct hardware control and affects performance."

    {
      "question": "When implementing server consolidation in a datacenter, why would an organization choose a bare-metal hypervisor architecture over alternatives?",
      "options": [
        "It eliminates the need for hardware virtualization extensions",
        "It reduces the attack surface by removing the host OS layer and provides better resource utilization",
        "It allows easier integration with existing desktop management tools",
        "It provides automatic failover capabilities that hosted hypervisors cannot offer"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Bare-metal (Type 1) hypervisors reduce the attack surface by eliminating the host OS layer, provide better resource utilization through direct hardware access, and offer improved security isolation - critical factors for datacenter consolidation where multiple workloads share physical hardware."
