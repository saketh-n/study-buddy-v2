    {
      "question": "What is the primary role of CNI plugins in a Kubernetes cluster?",
      "options": [
        "To manage container storage volumes",
        "To provide standardized network configuration for pods",
        "To handle container image distribution",
        "To monitor cluster resource utilization"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "CNI plugins implement the Container Network Interface specification to provide standardized network configuration, IP assignment, and connectivity for pods in Kubernetes clusters."
    },
    {
      "question": "A development team needs to deploy a multi-tier application across different nodes in a Kubernetes cluster, where frontend pods need to communicate with backend pods. Which CNI plugin characteristic is most critical for this scenario?",
      "options": [
        "Storage encryption capabilities",
        "Cross-node pod-to-pod communication",
        "Container image caching",
        "CPU resource allocation"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "For multi-tier applications spanning different nodes, the CNI plugin must enable seamless cross-node pod-to-pod communication, which is a core networking requirement that plugins like Calico and Flannel provide."
    },
    {
      "question": "When comparing Calico and Flannel CNI plugins, what is a key architectural difference that would influence your choice?",
      "options": [
        "Calico only works with Docker, while Flannel works with any container runtime",
        "Calico provides Layer 3 routing with BGP, while Flannel typically uses overlay networks",
        "Flannel requires external load balancers, while Calico has built-in load balancing",
        "Calico is only for single-node clusters, while Flannel supports multi-node"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Calico uses Layer 3 routing with BGP protocol for direct routing between nodes, while Flannel typically creates overlay networks (like VXLAN) to encapsulate traffic, representing different approaches to pod networking."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a Kubernetes cluster, when a new pod is created, what sequence of events occurs for CNI network setup?",
      "options": [
        "CNI plugin assigns IP first, then kubelet creates the pod",
        "Pod is created, then CNI plugin is called to configure networking",
        "Kubernetes API server directly assigns IPs without CNI involvement",
        "CNI plugin pre-allocates all IPs before any pods are created"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The kubelet first creates the pod, then calls the configured CNI plugin to set up networking (create network namespace, assign IP, configure routes), ensuring the pod has proper network connectivity."
    },
    {
      "question": "A security-conscious organization needs network policies to isolate different application tiers. Which consideration is most important when selecting a CNI plugin for this requirement?",
      "options": [
        "The plugin's container image size",
        "Whether the plugin supports Kubernetes NetworkPolicy enforcement",
        "The plugin's installation complexity",
        "The plugin's compatibility with specific Linux distributions"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "For network isolation using Kubernetes NetworkPolicies, the CNI plugin must support policy enforcement. Calico has built-in policy support, while basic Flannel implementations require additional components for policy enforcement."
