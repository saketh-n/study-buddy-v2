      "question": "What is the primary architectural difference between Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors?",
      "options": [
        "Type 1 runs directly on hardware while Type 2 runs on top of a host operating system",
        "Type 1 supports more virtual machines than Type 2",
        "Type 1 uses hardware virtualization while Type 2 uses software emulation",
        "Type 1 is open source while Type 2 is proprietary"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Type 1 hypervisors (bare-metal) install directly on physical hardware without a host OS, while Type 2 hypervisors run as applications on top of an existing operating system."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company needs to deploy a virtualization solution for their data center that maximizes performance and minimizes overhead. Which approach should they choose and why?",
      "options": [
        "Type 2 hypervisor because it provides better hardware compatibility",
        "Type 1 hypervisor because it eliminates the host OS layer, reducing overhead and improving performance",
        "Type 2 hypervisor because it's easier to manage and update",
        "Type 1 hypervisor because it supports more guest operating systems"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Type 1 hypervisors like ESXi provide better performance for data center environments because they run directly on hardware without the overhead of a host operating system layer."
    },
    {
      "question": "A developer wants to test applications on multiple operating systems on their laptop without rebooting. Which virtualization solution would be most appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "VMware ESXi because it provides enterprise-grade features",
        "Type 1 hypervisor because it offers better isolation",
        "VMware Fusion or similar Type 2 hypervisor because it allows running VMs alongside the host OS",
        "Container technology because it's more lightweight"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Type 2 hypervisors like VMware Fusion are ideal for desktop use cases where users need to run multiple operating systems simultaneously while maintaining access to their primary host OS."
    },
    {
      "question": "In VMware ESXi architecture, what role does the VMkernel play?",
      "options": [
        "It provides the guest operating system with direct hardware access",
        "It serves as the hypervisor's microkernel that manages hardware resources and VM scheduling",
        "It handles only network communication between virtual machines",
        "It acts as a backup system in case the primary hypervisor fails"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The VMkernel is ESXi's microkernel that directly manages hardware resources, handles VM scheduling, memory management, and provides core hypervisor functionality."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why might an organization choose to use nested virtualization (running a hypervisor inside a VM) despite the performance overhead?",
      "options": [
        "To improve overall system performance",
        "To reduce licensing costs",
        "For testing hypervisor configurations and training purposes without dedicated hardware",
        "To increase the number of supported guest operating systems"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Nested virtualization is primarily used for lab environments, testing hypervisor configurations, training scenarios, and development work where the flexibility outweighs the performance penalty."
