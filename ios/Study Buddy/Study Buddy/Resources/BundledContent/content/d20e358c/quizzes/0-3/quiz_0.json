    {
      "question": "What is the primary role of the KVM module in the Linux virtualization stack?",
      "options": [
        "It provides device emulation for virtual machines",
        "It transforms the Linux kernel into a Type-1 hypervisor",
        "It manages virtual machine disk storage",
        "It handles network virtualization for containers"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a kernel module that transforms the Linux kernel into a Type-1 hypervisor by providing virtualization infrastructure and direct access to hardware virtualization extensions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would you choose KVM over container technologies like Docker for running legacy Windows applications on a Linux server?",
      "options": [
        "KVM provides better network performance than containers",
        "KVM uses less memory overhead compared to containers",
        "KVM provides full OS isolation allowing different operating systems to run",
        "KVM offers better horizontal scaling capabilities"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "KVM provides full virtualization with complete OS isolation, allowing you to run different operating systems (like Windows) on a Linux host, while containers share the host OS kernel and cannot run different operating systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a KVM implementation, what is the relationship between KVM and QEMU?",
      "options": [
        "QEMU replaces KVM for better performance",
        "KVM handles device emulation while QEMU provides hardware acceleration",
        "QEMU provides device emulation while KVM provides hardware acceleration",
        "They are competing technologies that cannot be used together"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "QEMU provides device emulation (virtual hardware like network cards, storage, etc.) while KVM provides hardware acceleration through CPU virtualization extensions, working together to create a complete virtualization solution."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would KVM be preferred over VMware vSphere in an enterprise environment?",
      "options": [
        "When you need the most advanced management features available",
        "When you want to avoid vendor lock-in and reduce licensing costs",
        "When you require the highest level of technical support",
        "When you need to run the maximum number of concurrent VMs"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "KVM is open-source and avoids vendor lock-in while reducing licensing costs compared to proprietary solutions like VMware vSphere, making it attractive for organizations seeking cost-effective virtualization without licensing fees."
    },
    {
      "question": "A system administrator notices that KVM virtual machines are running slower than expected. What hardware feature should they verify is enabled and supported?",
      "options": [
        "Intel Turbo Boost or AMD Turbo Core",
        "Hardware virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)",
        "Intel Hyperthreading or AMD SMT",
        "ECC memory support"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "KVM requires hardware virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) to function efficiently. Without these extensions, VMs would run in software emulation mode, resulting in significantly degraded performance."
