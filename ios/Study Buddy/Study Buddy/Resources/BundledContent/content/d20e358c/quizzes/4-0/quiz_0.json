    {
      "question": "A microservices application experiences unpredictable traffic spikes throughout the day. Which Kubernetes feature would be most appropriate to automatically handle these variations without manual intervention?",
      "options": [
        "Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)",
        "DaemonSet",
        "StatefulSet",
        "Job"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "HPA automatically scales the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization or custom metrics, making it ideal for handling unpredictable traffic spikes without manual intervention."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would you choose Kubernetes orchestration over simply running containers directly on virtual machines for a distributed application?",
      "options": [
        "Kubernetes containers run faster than VM containers",
        "Kubernetes provides automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications",
        "Kubernetes eliminates the need for load balancers",
        "Kubernetes containers use less memory than VM containers"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Kubernetes orchestration provides automated deployment, scaling, health monitoring, and management capabilities that would otherwise require significant manual effort when running containers directly on VMs."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a Kubernetes cluster, if a node fails and becomes unreachable, what happens to the pods running on that node?",
      "options": [
        "The pods continue running on the failed node until manually moved",
        "Kubernetes immediately reschedules the pods on healthy nodes",
        "The pods are permanently lost and must be manually recreated",
        "Kubernetes waits for the node to recover before taking any action"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Kubernetes provides resilience by automatically detecting node failures and rescheduling pods from failed nodes onto healthy nodes, ensuring application availability."
    },
    {
      "question": "A development team needs to deploy a database that requires persistent storage and ordered deployment/scaling. Which Kubernetes workload type is most suitable?",
      "options": [
        "Deployment",
        "DaemonSet",
        "StatefulSet",
        "ReplicaSet"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "StatefulSet is designed for stateful applications like databases that require persistent storage, stable network identities, and ordered deployment/scaling operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a distributed system managed by Kubernetes, how does the control plane maintain the desired state of applications across multiple nodes?",
      "options": [
        "By manually configuring each node individually",
        "By continuously monitoring actual state and reconciling it with the declared desired state",
        "By restarting all nodes when changes are needed",
        "By requiring manual approval for each state change"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Kubernetes follows a declarative model where the control plane continuously monitors the actual state of resources and automatically reconciles any differences with the desired state specified in manifests."
