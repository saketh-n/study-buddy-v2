    {
      "question": "What is the primary architectural advantage of OpenStack's modular design with separate services like Nova, Neutron, and Cinder?",
      "options": [
        "It allows organizations to deploy only the services they need and scale components independently",
        "It reduces the total cost of ownership by eliminating the need for third-party software",
        "It automatically optimizes resource allocation across all cloud services",
        "It provides built-in security encryption for all data transfers"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "OpenStack's modular architecture allows organizations to choose which services to deploy based on their specific needs and scale individual components independently, providing flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company needs to migrate from proprietary cloud infrastructure to avoid vendor lock-in while maintaining full control over their cloud environment. Why would OpenStack be a suitable solution for this scenario?",
      "options": [
        "OpenStack automatically migrates data from any proprietary cloud platform",
        "OpenStack is open source and provides APIs that prevent dependency on specific vendors",
        "OpenStack offers the lowest operational costs compared to all other cloud solutions",
        "OpenStack includes built-in compliance certifications for all industries"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "OpenStack's open-source nature and standardized APIs allow organizations to avoid vendor lock-in by providing full control over their cloud infrastructure without dependency on proprietary solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which OpenStack service relationship correctly describes how compute instances access persistent storage?",
      "options": [
        "Nova directly manages block storage devices without requiring additional services",
        "Neutron provides both networking and storage capabilities for compute instances",
        "Nova integrates with Cinder to attach persistent block storage volumes to instances",
        "Swift automatically provides block storage for all Nova compute instances"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Nova (compute service) integrates with Cinder (block storage service) to provide persistent storage volumes that can be attached to compute instances, while Swift provides object storage and Neutron handles networking."
    },
    {
      "question": "An organization wants to implement a private cloud that can later integrate with public cloud services using the same APIs and management tools. What makes OpenStack particularly well-suited for this hybrid cloud strategy?",
      "options": [
        "OpenStack automatically replicates data across private and public clouds",
        "OpenStack uses standardized APIs that are compatible with many public cloud providers",
        "OpenStack provides free licensing for unlimited public cloud usage",
        "OpenStack includes built-in VPN tunnels to all major public cloud providers"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "OpenStack's standardized APIs and open architecture make it easier to create hybrid cloud environments where the same tools and interfaces can be used across private and compatible public cloud services."
    },
    {
      "question": "When evaluating OpenStack for a production environment, what is the most critical consideration regarding operational complexity?",
      "options": [
        "OpenStack requires specialized hardware that is expensive to procure",
        "OpenStack demands significant expertise for deployment, maintenance, and troubleshooting",
        "OpenStack can only run on Linux operating systems",
        "OpenStack automatically scales without any administrative intervention"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "While OpenStack provides powerful cloud capabilities, it requires substantial technical expertise for proper deployment, ongoing maintenance, and troubleshooting due to its complexity and the coordination needed between multiple services."
