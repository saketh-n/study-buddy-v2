    {
      "question": "Why is an init process like tini particularly important in Docker containers when running applications that spawn child processes?",
      "options": [
        "To improve container startup performance",
        "To handle zombie process cleanup and signal forwarding",
        "To provide better logging capabilities",
        "To enable container networking features"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Tini serves as PID 1 in containers to properly reap zombie processes and forward signals to child processes, preventing resource leaks and ensuring clean shutdowns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when a Docker container runs without an init process and the main application crashes, leaving orphaned child processes?",
      "options": [
        "Child processes automatically terminate",
        "Docker daemon kills all processes immediately",
        "Child processes become zombies and consume system resources",
        "The container automatically restarts"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Without a proper init process, orphaned child processes become zombies that cannot be reaped, leading to resource consumption and potential system issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "In which scenario would you MOST likely need tini or a similar init process in your Docker container?",
      "options": [
        "Running a simple single-threaded web server",
        "Running a Node.js application that spawns worker processes",
        "Serving static files with nginx",
        "Running a basic database query script"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Applications that spawn child processes (like Node.js with workers) need proper process management to handle zombie cleanup and signal propagation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Docker's --init flag affect the container runtime flow?",
      "options": [
        "It enables faster container startup times",
        "It automatically injects tini as PID 1 before running your application",
        "It provides additional security isolation",
        "It enables container health checks"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The --init flag instructs Docker to use tini as the init process (PID 1), which then spawns and manages your application as a child process."
    },
    {
      "question": "When a SIGTERM signal is sent to a Docker container using tini, what is the correct sequence of events?",
      "options": [
        "Tini immediately kills all processes in the container",
        "Tini forwards SIGTERM to the main application, waits for graceful shutdown, then handles cleanup",
        "Docker daemon bypasses tini and signals the application directly",
        "The container stops without any signal processing"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Tini receives the SIGTERM, forwards it to the main application for graceful shutdown, waits for the process to exit, and handles any remaining cleanup including zombie reaping."
