    {
      "question": "You are working with a dataset containing customer ages ranging from 18 to 85, and annual incomes ranging from $20,000 to $500,000. Why would normalization be particularly important before applying a distance-based algorithm like k-means clustering?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce computational complexity and speed up the algorithm",
        "To prevent the income feature from dominating the distance calculations due to its larger scale",
        "To eliminate outliers in both age and income distributions",
        "To convert categorical variables into numerical format"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Income values are much larger in magnitude than age values, so without normalization, the distance calculations would be dominated by income differences, making age nearly irrelevant in the clustering process."
    },
    {
      "question": "A dataset has 10,000 records with a 'phone_number' column that is 95% missing. The remaining 5% of phone numbers appear to be randomly distributed across different customer segments. What is the most appropriate approach?",
      "options": [
        "Use forward fill to propagate the available phone numbers",
        "Drop all records that are missing phone numbers",
        "Create a binary indicator feature for 'has_phone' and drop the original column",
        "Impute missing values using the most frequent phone number"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "With 95% missing data that appears random, imputation would be unreliable. Creating a binary indicator preserves the information about whether a phone number was provided while avoiding the issues of high missingness."
    },
    {
      "question": "When creating features from a datetime column for predicting retail sales, which feature engineering approach would likely be LEAST useful?",
      "options": [
        "Extracting day of week to capture weekly shopping patterns",
        "Creating a binary feature for holiday vs non-holiday periods",
        "Converting the datetime to a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch)",
        "Extracting month to capture seasonal trends"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Unix timestamps create arbitrarily large numbers without meaningful relationships to sales patterns. Day of week, holidays, and months all capture interpretable cyclical patterns relevant to retail behavior."
    },
    {
      "question": "You notice that 15% of entries in a 'customer_satisfaction_score' column (scale 1-10) are missing, and these missing values are primarily from customers who made complaints. What does this suggest about the missing data mechanism?",
      "options": [
        "Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) - safe to use simple imputation",
        "Missing At Random (MAR) - can use advanced imputation methods",
        "Missing Not At Random (MNAR) - the missingness is meaningful and should be explicitly modeled",
        "Missing due to data collection errors - should remove these records"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "The missing satisfaction scores are systematically related to complaint behavior, suggesting customers who complained may have deliberately not provided scores. This makes the missingness informative and not random."
    },
    {
      "question": "A feature called 'years_of_education' has values ranging from 0 to 25, but contains obvious errors like negative values and values over 30. After identifying these outliers, what is the most principled approach to handle them?",
      "options": [
        "Remove all records containing any outlier values",
        "Replace outliers with the mean value of the feature",
        "Cap all values above 20 at exactly 20, and set negative values to 0",
        "Investigate the source of errors and develop domain-specific rules for correction or removal"
      ],
      "correct_index": 3,
      "explanation": "Understanding why outliers occur is crucial for proper handling. Domain knowledge about education can help determine if values like 25 years might be valid (PhD + additional training) versus clearly erroneous negative values."
