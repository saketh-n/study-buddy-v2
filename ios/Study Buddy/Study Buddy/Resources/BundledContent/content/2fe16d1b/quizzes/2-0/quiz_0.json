    {
      "question": "Which scenario is MOST appropriate for using linear regression?",
      "options": [
        "Classifying emails as spam or not spam",
        "Predicting house prices based on square footage and location",
        "Clustering customers into different segments",
        "Recognizing handwritten digits"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Linear regression is designed for predicting continuous numerical values (like house prices) based on input features. The other options involve classification or unsupervised learning tasks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the slope coefficient in a linear regression model represent?",
      "options": [
        "The predicted value when all features equal zero",
        "The change in the target variable for a one-unit increase in that feature",
        "The correlation between all features",
        "The total error in the model"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The slope coefficient indicates how much the dependent variable (target) changes when the independent variable (feature) increases by one unit, holding other variables constant."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why might linear regression perform poorly on a dataset where the relationship between features and target follows a curved pattern?",
      "options": [
        "Linear regression can only handle categorical data",
        "Linear regression assumes a straight-line relationship between variables",
        "Linear regression requires too much computational power",
        "Linear regression cannot handle multiple features"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable. When the true relationship is curved or non-linear, a straight line cannot capture the pattern effectively, leading to poor predictions."

    {
      "question": "A linear regression model predicts student test scores based on hours studied. The model equation is: Score = 60 + 5 \u00d7 Hours. What does this tell you?",
      "options": [
        "Students who don't study at all are predicted to score 5 points",
        "Each additional hour of study is associated with a 5-point increase in score",
        "The maximum possible score is 65 points",
        "Students must study at least 60 hours to pass"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The coefficient 5 means that for each additional hour studied, the predicted test score increases by 5 points. The intercept (60) represents the predicted score when hours studied equals zero."
    },
    {
      "question": "When evaluating a linear regression model, you notice that predictions are consistently too high for low actual values and too low for high actual values. What does this suggest?",
      "options": [
        "The model has perfect accuracy",
        "The model likely has a non-linear relationship that linear regression cannot capture",
        "The model needs more training data",
        "The features are highly correlated with each other"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "This pattern suggests the true relationship is curved rather than linear. A straight line tends to underestimate at the extremes when the actual relationship curves upward, indicating that a non-linear model might be more appropriate."
