      "question": "A supermarket wants to understand which products are frequently bought together to optimize store layout. Which scenario would be MOST appropriate for association rule mining?",
      "options": [
        "Analyzing transaction data to find products that appear together in shopping baskets",
        "Predicting the exact sales revenue for next quarter based on historical data",
        "Classifying customers into demographic groups based on their age and income",
        "Forecasting when a specific customer will make their next purchase"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Association rule mining is specifically designed to find relationships between items that frequently co-occur in transactions, making it perfect for market basket analysis to understand purchasing patterns."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the association rule 'Bread \u2192 Butter' with support = 0.3, confidence = 0.8, and lift = 1.5, what does the lift value of 1.5 indicate?",
      "options": [
        "Butter appears in 1.5% of all transactions",
        "People who buy bread are 1.5 times more likely to buy butter than random customers",
        "The rule is incorrect because lift should be less than 1",
        "Bread and butter appear together in exactly 1.5% of transactions"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Lift measures how much more likely the consequent (butter) is to be purchased when the antecedent (bread) is present, compared to its baseline probability. A lift > 1 indicates positive correlation."
    },
    {
      "question": "An analyst finds the rule 'Diapers \u2192 Beer' with high confidence but very low support. What should be their primary concern about using this rule for business decisions?",
      "options": [
        "The rule is statistically unreliable because it occurs in very few transactions",
        "The confidence is calculated incorrectly since these items are unrelated",
        "The rule indicates a negative correlation that should be ignored",
        "High confidence always means the rule is actionable regardless of support"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Low support means the rule applies to very few transactions, making it statistically unreliable for broad business decisions even if the confidence is high when it does occur."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company discovers that customers who buy laptops also frequently buy laptop bags (confidence = 0.9). However, very few customers overall buy laptops (support = 0.02). Why might this rule still be valuable?",
      "options": [
        "Low support rules should always be discarded as they are meaningless",
        "The rule could be useful for targeted recommendations to the specific segment buying laptops",
        "High confidence automatically makes any rule profitable to implement",
        "The support value must be incorrect because laptop buyers always need bags"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Even with low support, a rule with high confidence can be valuable for targeted strategies affecting specific customer segments, such as recommending laptop bags to laptop purchasers."

      "question": "When would you choose association rule mining over other machine learning techniques for analyzing customer behavior?",
      "options": [
        "When you need to predict specific numerical outcomes like sales amounts",
        "When you want to classify customers into predefined categories",
        "When you need to discover unknown relationships between products without predefined hypotheses",
        "When you want to reduce the dimensionality of your customer dataset"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Association rule mining excels at discovering unexpected patterns and relationships in data without requiring predefined hypotheses, making it ideal for exploratory analysis of item relationships."
