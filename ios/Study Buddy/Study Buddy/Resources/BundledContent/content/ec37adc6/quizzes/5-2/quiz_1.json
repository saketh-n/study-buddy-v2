      "question": "A patient with type 2 diabetes and obesity has plateaued on semaglutide 2.4mg with 8% weight loss but needs additional metabolic improvement. What is the primary advantage of switching to tirzepatide over increasing current therapy?",
      "options": [
        "Tirzepatide has a longer half-life allowing weekly dosing",
        "The dual GLP-1/GIP agonism provides enhanced insulin sensitivity and weight loss",
        "Tirzepatide can be administered orally unlike semaglutide",
        "Tirzepatide has fewer gastrointestinal side effects"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Tirzepatide's dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonism provides synergistic effects on glucose control and weight loss through enhanced insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and appetite suppression beyond what GLP-1 alone can achieve."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would oral semaglutide be preferred over subcutaneous formulations for a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patient?",
      "options": [
        "When rapid onset of action is needed for severe hyperglycemia",
        "For patients with needle phobia who can adhere to strict dosing requirements",
        "When combination with insulin therapy is planned",
        "For patients requiring maximum efficacy and weight loss"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Oral semaglutide is ideal for patients with injection aversion, but requires strict fasting administration and has lower bioavailability. It's not suitable for rapid glycemic control or maximum efficacy needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "A triple hormone agonist (GLP-1/GIP/glucagon) is being developed. What is the primary therapeutic rationale for adding glucagon receptor activation to dual GLP-1/GIP therapy?",
      "options": [
        "Glucagon activation reduces hypoglycemia risk by stimulating glucose production",
        "Glucagon enhances insulin secretion synergistically with GLP-1 and GIP",
        "Glucagon increases energy expenditure and hepatic fat oxidation",
        "Glucagon improves gastric emptying to reduce GI side effects"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Glucagon receptor activation increases energy expenditure, promotes lipolysis, and enhances hepatic fat oxidation, potentially providing additional weight loss and metabolic benefits beyond glucose control."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does oral semaglutide require co-administration with SNAC (sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate) and strict fasting conditions?",
      "options": [
        "SNAC prevents degradation by DPP-4 enzymes in the intestine",
        "SNAC enhances local absorption by increasing intestinal pH and tight junction permeability",
        "SNAC provides sustained release to match subcutaneous pharmacokinetics",
        "SNAC reduces gastrointestinal side effects through buffering action"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "SNAC is an absorption enhancer that raises local gastric pH and transiently increases epithelial permeability, facilitating absorption of the large semaglutide molecule. Fasting conditions prevent food interference with this process."
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient experiences excellent glycemic control on dulaglutide but requests switching to an oral GLP-1 RA due to injection site reactions. What is the most important counseling point about this transition?",
      "options": [
        "Oral formulations have superior cardiovascular outcomes compared to injectable forms",
        "The oral medication can be taken with breakfast for better tolerance",
        "There will likely be some reduction in glycemic efficacy requiring monitoring",
        "Oral GLP-1 RAs have faster onset requiring immediate dose adjustments"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Oral semaglutide has lower bioavailability (~1%) compared to subcutaneous GLP-1 RAs, often resulting in reduced glycemic efficacy. Patients should be counseled about potential efficacy differences and need for monitoring."
