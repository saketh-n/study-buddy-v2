    {
      "question": "A patient with type 2 diabetes develops gastroparesis as a side effect of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy. Which mechanism best explains this adverse effect?",
      "options": [
        "Direct toxic damage to vagal nerve fibers",
        "GLP-1 receptor activation in the stomach causing delayed gastric emptying",
        "Hypoglycemia-induced autonomic dysfunction",
        "Pancreatic enzyme deficiency from beta-cell overstimulation"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "GLP-1 receptors in the GI tract mediate delayed gastric emptying as part of the incretin effect, which helps regulate postprandial glucose but can cause gastroparesis in some patients."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do GLP-1 receptor agonists typically cause weight loss rather than weight gain, unlike many other diabetes medications?",
      "options": [
        "They increase metabolic rate through thyroid hormone activation",
        "They cause malabsorption by inhibiting pancreatic enzymes",
        "They activate satiety centers in the hypothalamus and delay gastric emptying",
        "They block glucose absorption in the small intestine"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "GLP-1 receptors in the hypothalamus regulate appetite and satiety, while GI tract receptors slow gastric emptying, both contributing to reduced food intake and weight loss."
    },
    {
      "question": "A cardiologist considers GLP-1 receptor agonists for a diabetic patient with heart failure. What cardiovascular mechanism makes this therapeutic choice particularly beneficial?",
      "options": [
        "Direct positive inotropic effects on cardiac muscle",
        "Reduction in cardiac afterload through peripheral vasodilation",
        "Improved endothelial function and potential cardioprotective effects",
        "Increased heart rate variability through autonomic modulation"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "GLP-1 receptors in cardiovascular tissues contribute to endothelial function improvement and cardioprotection, explaining the cardiovascular benefits seen in clinical trials beyond glucose control."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would the pancreatic effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists be most clinically relevant for glucose control?",
      "options": [
        "During fasting states when baseline insulin is needed",
        "In the postprandial period when glucose levels are elevated",
        "Only in patients with complete beta-cell failure",
        "Equally at all times regardless of glucose levels"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "GLP-1's glucose-dependent insulin release from pancreatic beta cells is most active when glucose levels are elevated, making it particularly effective for postprandial glucose control with low hypoglycemia risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient experiences nausea and early satiety when starting GLP-1 therapy. Understanding tissue distribution, which approach would be most appropriate for management?",
      "options": [
        "Switch to a different class of medication immediately",
        "Gradually titrate the dose to allow GI tract adaptation",
        "Add a prokinetic agent to counteract all GLP-1 effects",
        "Recommend taking the medication only with large meals"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "GI side effects result from GLP-1 receptor activation in the GI tract. Gradual dose titration allows adaptation while maintaining therapeutic benefits from pancreatic, CNS, and cardiovascular receptor activation."
