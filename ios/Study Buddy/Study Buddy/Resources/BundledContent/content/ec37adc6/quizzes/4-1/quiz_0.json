      "question": "A pharmacy receives a shipment of GLP-1 receptor agonist pens that were exposed to 45\u00b0F (7\u00b0C) for 30 minutes during transport. What is the most appropriate action?",
      "options": [
        "Immediately discard all medication as it's been compromised",
        "Store normally and dispense as usual since the exposure was brief",
        "Contact the manufacturer for guidance and quarantine the shipment",
        "Test one pen to see if it still works before dispensing others"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Even brief temperature excursions outside the required 36-46\u00b0F range require manufacturer consultation to determine product viability, as protein stability can be affected by temperature variations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are GLP-1 receptor agonists more sensitive to temperature variations compared to traditional small-molecule diabetes medications?",
      "options": [
        "They contain more active ingredient per dose",
        "They are protein-based biologics that can denature when heated",
        "They are formulated in liquid rather than solid form",
        "They have a shorter shelf life than other medications"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "GLP-1 agonists are protein-based biologics that can lose their three-dimensional structure and therapeutic activity when exposed to temperature extremes, unlike small-molecule drugs that are more chemically stable."
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient is traveling internationally for 3 weeks and needs to bring their GLP-1 medication. Which scenario represents the most critical cold chain consideration?",
      "options": [
        "Ensuring they have enough medication for the entire trip",
        "Keeping medication in carry-on luggage to avoid cargo hold freezing",
        "Obtaining a prescription in the destination country",
        "Using insulated packaging for the return flight"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Cargo holds can reach freezing temperatures that would permanently damage GLP-1 medications. Carry-on luggage maintains cabin temperature, preserving medication integrity throughout travel."
    },
    {
      "question": "During a power outage lasting 6 hours, a clinic's refrigerator temperature rises to 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C). The GLP-1 medications inside are worth $15,000. What principle should guide the decision-making process?",
      "options": [
        "Financial cost should determine whether to keep or discard the medications",
        "Patient safety requires assuming the medications are compromised regardless of cost",
        "The medications can be used if patients are informed of the temperature exposure",
        "A 6-hour exposure is acceptable as long as temperatures didn't exceed 60\u00b0F"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Patient safety must always take precedence over financial considerations. Temperature-compromised biologics may have reduced efficacy or altered properties, potentially leading to treatment failure or adverse effects."
    },
    {
      "question": "When implementing a cold chain monitoring system for GLP-1 medications, which approach would be most effective for preventing therapeutic failures?",
      "options": [
        "Installing backup generators for all refrigeration units",
        "Using continuous digital temperature monitoring with real-time alerts",
        "Training staff to check temperatures every 4 hours manually",
        "Maintaining detailed logs of all medication lot numbers and expiration dates"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Continuous digital monitoring with real-time alerts enables immediate response to temperature excursions, minimizing exposure time and potential medication compromise, which is critical for maintaining therapeutic efficacy."
