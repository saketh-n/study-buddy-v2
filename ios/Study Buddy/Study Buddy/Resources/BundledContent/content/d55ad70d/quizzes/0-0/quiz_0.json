      "question": "A video editing company needs storage that allows instant access to frequently used video clips while maintaining reasonable cost for large archives. Which storage hierarchy would be most appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "SSDs for all storage to maximize speed",
        "A combination of SSDs for active projects and HDDs for archived footage",
        "Cloud storage only for automatic backup",
        "RAM-based storage for all video files"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "A hybrid approach using fast SSDs for active work and cost-effective HDDs for archives balances performance needs with budget constraints, which is typical in professional video editing workflows."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is volatile memory (RAM) not suitable as primary storage for user documents and applications?",
      "options": [
        "It is too expensive compared to other storage types",
        "It loses all data when power is removed from the system",
        "It has slower access times than hard drives",
        "It cannot store more than a few megabytes of data"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Volatile memory loses all stored data when power is disconnected, making it unsuitable for permanent storage of documents and programs that need to persist between computer sessions."
    },
    {
      "question": "A database server experiences high user traffic with frequent random read/write operations. Which storage characteristic would have the greatest impact on performance?",
      "options": [
        "Total storage capacity",
        "Sequential read speed",
        "Random access time (latency)",
        "Physical storage size"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Database operations typically involve many random access patterns rather than sequential reads. Low random access time (latency) is crucial for quickly locating and retrieving scattered data records."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would magnetic tape storage be preferred over solid-state drives despite being much slower?",
      "options": [
        "For operating system installation",
        "For long-term archival of large datasets that are rarely accessed",
        "For gaming applications requiring fast loading",
        "For temporary file storage during active work"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Magnetic tape excels in archival scenarios where massive amounts of data need long-term storage at very low cost, and the slow access time is acceptable because the data is rarely retrieved."

    {
      "question": "A mobile application developer is choosing storage for a smartphone app that needs to save user preferences and small amounts of data locally. What storage consideration is most critical for this use case?",
      "options": [
        "Maximum possible storage capacity",
        "Power efficiency and durability with no moving parts",
        "Lowest possible cost per gigabyte",
        "Compatibility with magnetic storage standards"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Mobile devices prioritize power efficiency and durability. Solid-state storage with no moving parts is ideal for mobile applications as it consumes less power, withstands physical movement, and provides adequate performance for small data storage needs."
