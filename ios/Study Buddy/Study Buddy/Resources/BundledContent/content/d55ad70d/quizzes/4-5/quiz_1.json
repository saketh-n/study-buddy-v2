      "question": "What is the primary purpose of filesystem abstraction layers in modern operating systems?",
      "options": [
        "To increase storage capacity by compressing files",
        "To provide a uniform interface for different filesystem types while hiding implementation details",
        "To encrypt all file operations for security",
        "To automatically backup files to multiple locations"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Filesystem abstraction layers create a consistent interface that allows applications to work with different filesystem types (ext4, NTFS, FAT32, etc.) without knowing the underlying implementation details."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would you most likely implement a virtual filesystem (VFS) layer in a system design?",
      "options": [
        "When you need to optimize disk read speeds",
        "When you want to support multiple filesystem formats and provide a unified API",
        "When you need to reduce memory usage",
        "When you want to implement file compression"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "VFS is implemented when you need to support multiple filesystem types while providing applications with a single, consistent interface for file operations, regardless of the underlying filesystem format."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a layered filesystem architecture, what happens when an application calls a standard file operation like 'open()'?",
      "options": [
        "The call goes directly to the hardware driver",
        "The call is processed by the VFS layer, which then delegates to the appropriate filesystem-specific implementation",
        "The call is immediately cached in memory",
        "The call triggers a backup operation"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "The VFS layer acts as an intermediary, receiving the generic 'open()' call and translating it to the specific implementation required by the underlying filesystem (ext4, NTFS, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why might a system administrator choose to use filesystem layering with union mounts or overlay filesystems?",
      "options": [
        "To permanently merge multiple disks into one larger disk",
        "To create a read-only base layer with a writable overlay, useful for containers or system rollback capabilities",
        "To automatically encrypt sensitive files",
        "To improve network file transfer speeds"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Union mounts and overlay filesystems allow combining multiple filesystem layers, typically with a read-only base and writable overlay, enabling use cases like container filesystems and system snapshots."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key advantage of implementing filesystem operations through multiple abstraction layers rather than having applications interact directly with storage hardware?",
      "options": [
        "Direct hardware access is always faster than layered access",
        "Layered systems automatically provide better security than direct access",
        "Applications remain portable and don't need modification when underlying storage technology changes",
        "Layered systems use less memory than direct hardware access"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Abstraction layers provide portability - applications can run on different storage systems and filesystem types without modification, as they interact with a consistent interface rather than hardware-specific implementations."
