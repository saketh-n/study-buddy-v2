    {
      "question": "What is the primary architectural difference between NFS and CIFS/SMB that affects their implementation in heterogeneous networks?",
      "options": [
        "NFS is stateless while CIFS/SMB maintains session state",
        "NFS uses TCP while CIFS/SMB uses UDP",
        "NFS requires authentication while CIFS/SMB does not",
        "NFS works only with databases while CIFS/SMB works with files"
      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "NFS operates as a stateless protocol, meaning the server doesn't maintain information about client connections between requests, while CIFS/SMB maintains session state and connection information, which affects reliability, recovery, and resource management."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company needs to share files between Linux servers, Windows workstations, and macOS clients while ensuring optimal performance for each platform. Which approach would be most appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Use only NFS for all platforms since it's faster",
        "Use only CIFS/SMB since it's more secure",
        "Implement both NFS for Unix/Linux systems and CIFS/SMB for Windows systems",
        "Use FTP for cross-platform compatibility"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "A hybrid approach using both protocols leverages the strengths of each: NFS provides optimal performance for Unix/Linux environments, while CIFS/SMB offers native integration with Windows systems and better support for Windows-specific features like ACLs."
    },
    {
      "question": "When would you choose NFS over CIFS/SMB for a network file system implementation?",
      "options": [
        "When you need strong Windows integration and complex permissions",
        "When you have primarily Unix/Linux environments requiring high-performance file access",
        "When you need built-in file locking and caching mechanisms",
        "When security is the primary concern"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "NFS is typically preferred in Unix/Linux environments due to its lightweight design, lower protocol overhead, and better performance characteristics for these systems, especially in high-throughput scenarios."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when an NFS server crashes and then restarts, compared to a CIFS/SMB server in the same situation?",
      "options": [
        "Both require all clients to reconnect and lose their work",
        "NFS clients can continue seamlessly while CIFS/SMB clients must re-establish sessions",
        "CIFS/SMB clients recover faster due to better error handling",
        "Both protocols handle crashes identically"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Due to NFS's stateless design, clients can resume operations immediately when the server returns without losing state information. CIFS/SMB clients must re-establish their sessions and may lose some connection state, though modern implementations have improved recovery mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "question": "A database application needs to store files on a network storage system where multiple servers will simultaneously read and write data. Which consideration is most critical for choosing between NFS and CIFS/SMB?",
      "options": [
        "The operating system of the client machines",
        "The file locking and concurrency control mechanisms of each protocol",
        "The maximum file size supported by each protocol",
        "The encryption capabilities of each protocol"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "For applications requiring concurrent access with data integrity, the file locking and concurrency mechanisms are crucial. CIFS/SMB generally provides more robust byte-range locking and opportunistic locking features, while NFS locking can be more complex to implement correctly for such scenarios."
