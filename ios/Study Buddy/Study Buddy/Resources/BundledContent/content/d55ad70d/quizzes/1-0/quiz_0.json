    {
      "question": "Why are disk sectors typically organized in fixed sizes (like 512 bytes or 4KB) rather than variable sizes that match file content exactly?",
      "options": [
        "To make disk manufacturing cheaper",
        "To simplify addressing and reduce metadata overhead",
        "To ensure all files are the same size",
        "To prevent disk fragmentation completely"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Fixed sector sizes simplify the addressing scheme and reduce metadata overhead. The disk controller can calculate addresses mathematically rather than maintaining complex tables for variable-sized sectors."
    },
    {
      "question": "A database application needs to store records that are 2KB each. Given that the disk uses 4KB sectors, what is the most significant performance consideration?",
      "options": [
        "Each record will require exactly 2 disk reads",
        "Two records can be stored per sector, maximizing space efficiency",
        "Records will cause internal fragmentation within sectors",
        "The database will run out of storage space quickly"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Since each sector is 4KB and records are 2KB, two records fit perfectly in each sector, maximizing space efficiency and minimizing I/O operations when accessing multiple records."
    },
    {
      "question": "When a file system reports a file as 100 bytes but it occupies 4KB of disk space, this demonstrates which fundamental concept of disk storage?",
      "options": [
        "Disk compression is automatically applied",
        "The minimum allocation unit is one block/sector",
        "The file is corrupted and needs repair",
        "The operating system has a bug in size calculation"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "This demonstrates that storage is allocated in minimum units (blocks/sectors). Even though the file content is only 100 bytes, it must occupy at least one complete 4KB block, resulting in internal fragmentation."
    },
    {
      "question": "A system administrator notices that sequential file access is much faster than random access on traditional hard drives. This performance difference is primarily due to which aspect of disk geometry?",
      "options": [
        "Sequential files are automatically compressed",
        "The read/write head doesn't need to move between adjacent sectors",
        "Sequential files are stored in faster memory",
        "The operating system caches sequential files better"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "In traditional hard drives, sequential access is faster because the read/write head doesn't need to physically move (seek) to different tracks. Adjacent sectors can be read as the disk rotates, eliminating seek time."
    },
    {
      "question": "A video editing application needs to minimize storage latency for large files. Understanding disk block organization, which strategy would be most effective?",
      "options": [
        "Store files across multiple small partitions",
        "Use the smallest possible block size to reduce waste",
        "Ensure files are stored in contiguous blocks when possible",
        "Compress all video files to reduce their size"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Storing files in contiguous blocks minimizes seek time because the read/write head can access sequential data without moving to different areas of the disk, significantly reducing latency for large file operations."
