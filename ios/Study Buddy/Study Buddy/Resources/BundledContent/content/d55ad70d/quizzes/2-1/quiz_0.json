    {
      "question": "What is the primary advantage of using network file systems like NFS or CIFS-SMB over local file storage in a multi-user environment?",
      "options": [
        "Faster file access speeds",
        "Centralized file management and shared access",
        "Better data compression",
        "Lower hardware costs"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Network file systems enable multiple users to access the same files from different machines while maintaining centralized storage and management, which is their primary benefit over local storage."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company needs to share files between Linux servers and Windows workstations. Which combination would provide the best cross-platform compatibility?",
      "options": [
        "NFS only",
        "CIFS-SMB only",
        "Both NFS and CIFS-SMB protocols",
        "Local file replication"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Using both protocols allows Linux systems to communicate via NFS (their native protocol) while Windows systems can use CIFS-SMB (their native protocol), providing optimal compatibility for mixed environments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why might an administrator choose NFS over CIFS-SMB for a Linux-only server environment?",
      "options": [
        "NFS provides better security encryption",
        "NFS has lower network overhead and better performance on Unix-like systems",
        "NFS supports larger file sizes",
        "NFS works better over the internet"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "NFS is designed for Unix-like systems and typically has lower protocol overhead, making it more efficient for Linux-only environments compared to CIFS-SMB which was designed primarily for Windows systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a network file system setup, what happens when the file server becomes unavailable while a client is accessing files?",
      "options": [
        "Files are automatically cached locally and remain accessible",
        "Client applications may hang or receive I/O errors until the server returns",
        "Files are immediately transferred to the client's local storage",
        "The client automatically switches to a backup server"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Network file systems create a dependency on the server. When the server becomes unavailable, clients typically experience hangs or I/O errors since the files exist remotely, not locally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which scenario would be LEAST suitable for implementing a network file system solution?",
      "options": [
        "A design team sharing large CAD files across multiple workstations",
        "A database server requiring high-speed access to transaction logs",
        "An office sharing documents and spreadsheets among employees",
        "A development team collaborating on source code files"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Database servers require extremely low latency and high reliability for transaction logs. Network file systems introduce latency and potential points of failure that could severely impact database performance and reliability."
