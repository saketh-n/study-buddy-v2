    {
      "question": "What is the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes block storage from file storage?",
      "options": [
        "Block storage can only be accessed locally",
        "Block storage presents data as raw blocks that the operating system formats with a filesystem",
        "Block storage is always faster than file storage",
        "Block storage can only store structured data"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Block storage presents raw, unformatted blocks of data that the operating system then formats with a filesystem. This is different from file storage which presents a pre-formatted filesystem interface."
    },
    {
      "question": "A database administrator needs to provision storage for a high-performance database that requires low latency random access patterns. The storage must appear as a local drive to the database server but needs to be shared across multiple servers for failover purposes. Which solution would be most appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Network File System (NFS)",
        "Storage Area Network (SAN) with Fibre Channel",
        "Object storage like Amazon S3",
        "Direct-attached SATA drives"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "A SAN with Fibre Channel provides block-level access with low latency, appears as local storage to the OS, and can be shared across multiple servers for clustering and failover scenarios."
    },
    {
      "question": "When comparing local disk storage to iSCSI for a virtual machine environment, what is the primary trade-off an administrator must consider?",
      "options": [
        "Local disk is always more secure than iSCSI",
        "iSCSI provides better performance but requires more complex configuration",
        "Local disk offers better performance but iSCSI enables features like live migration and centralized management",
        "iSCSI can only be used with Linux virtual machines"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Local disk typically offers better performance due to no network overhead, but iSCSI enables advanced virtualization features like live VM migration and centralized storage management, despite some performance trade-offs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why might an organization choose iSCSI over Fibre Channel SAN for their block storage implementation?",
      "options": [
        "iSCSI provides better performance than Fibre Channel",
        "iSCSI can leverage existing Ethernet infrastructure and is more cost-effective",
        "iSCSI supports larger storage volumes than Fibre Channel",
        "iSCSI provides better data encryption capabilities"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "iSCSI runs over standard Ethernet networks, allowing organizations to leverage existing network infrastructure and expertise, making it more cost-effective than Fibre Channel which requires specialized hardware and skills."

    {
      "question": "In a block storage system, an application writes data to what appears to be block 1000 on a logical volume, but the storage system actually writes it to block 5000 on the physical disk. This scenario best demonstrates which concept?",
      "options": [
        "File system fragmentation",
        "Storage virtualization and logical block addressing",
        "Data compression",
        "RAID parity calculation"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "This demonstrates storage virtualization where logical block addresses (LBA) presented to the application are mapped to different physical block addresses on the storage device, providing flexibility in storage management."
